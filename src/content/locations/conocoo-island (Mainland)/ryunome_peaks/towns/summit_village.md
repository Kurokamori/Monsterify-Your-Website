# Summit Village (Sanchō no Mura 山頂の村)

This serene mountain settlement perches on a natural plateau near one of Ryunome Peaks' most sacred summits, offering breathtaking panoramic views and serving as an important waypoint for pilgrims and travelers. With its distinctive Japanese mountain temple architecture integrated with Flying and Dragon-type Pokémon habitats, Summit Village provides both a spiritual retreat for residents and an authentic cultural immersion for visitors seeking to understand the unique bond between the mountain people and their Pokémon partners.

## History

Founded over 500 years ago by the legendary monk Kaze no Ryu (Wind Dragon) and his partner Dragonite, Summit Village began as a meditation retreat where humans sought to learn from Flying-type Pokémon about freedom and perspective. According to local legend, the village site was chosen when Kaze no Ryu's Dragonite performed a ritual flight pattern around the plateau, creating wind currents that still flow through the village today in a distinctive spiral pattern.

The village gained prominence 300 years ago when a visiting Rayquaza allegedly blessed the settlement, creating a unique atmospheric phenomenon that allows certain Pokémon to achieve heightened states of consciousness here. This event is commemorated in the annual "Green Dragon Festival" and has made the village an important site for trainers seeking to deepen their bond with Flying and Dragon-type Pokémon.

## Town Features

- **Wind Circle Plaza** (Kaze no Wa Hiroba): The heart of community activity, featuring a circular stone platform with intricate dragon motifs carved into the pavement. The plaza is designed with special wind channels that create a natural whistle when mountain breezes pass through, producing tones that change with the seasons. Flying-type Pokémon like Altaria and Corviknight often gather here to ride the thermal currents that spiral upward from the center of the plaza. The plaza hosts daily meditation sessions at dawn and dusk, where humans and their Pokémon partners practice synchronized breathing techniques.

- **Sky Market** (Sora no Ichiba): An open-air market where goods are displayed on floating platforms maintained by Psychic-type Pokémon like Metagross and Claydol. The market specializes in mountain herbs, dragon scale crafts, and specially treated fabrics designed to withstand high-altitude conditions. A unique feature is the "Pokémon Exchange" section where Flying-types bring rare items from inaccessible peaks to trade with humans and other Pokémon. The market operates on a lunar calendar, with special night markets held during the full moon when the floating platforms are illuminated by Lanturn and Chinchou.

- **Dragon Harmony Hall** (Ryū no Chōwa-dō): The village's main community building, a pagoda-style structure with nine tiers representing the nine sacred Dragon Pokémon of Ryunome tradition. The hall serves multiple functions: the ground floor houses administrative offices where the village elders meet, the middle tiers contain classrooms where children learn alongside young Pokémon, and the upper levels feature meditation chambers with special acoustic properties that enhance psychic connections between humans and Pokémon. The hall's roof is designed as an aerie where messenger Pokémon like Pidgeot and Dragonite can rest between journeys.

- **Wind Path Residences** (Kaze no Michi Jūtaku): Residential areas built along spiraling pathways that follow natural wind currents. Homes are constructed in traditional Japanese mountain style with steep roofs and elevated foundations, but adapted with special features for Pokémon cohabitation. Many houses feature retractable roof sections that allow Flying-type partners to enter directly, interior perches integrated into the main living spaces, and meditation platforms where families and their Pokémon gather for daily mindfulness practices. The most distinctive homes belong to Dragon Path practitioners, with exteriors decorated in iridescent dragon scale mosaics that change color with the angle of sunlight.

- **Cloud Garden Terraces** (Kumo Niwa Terasu): Stepped agricultural areas where specialized mountain crops are grown in soil enriched by minerals collected by Flying-type Pokémon from distant peaks. These terraces are maintained through partnerships between human farmers and Pokémon like Tropius and Jumpluff who help manage the crops. The gardens produce rare herbs used in both human and Pokémon medicine, berries that enhance Flying and Dragon-type moves, and the distinctive "cloud tea" that Summit Village is famous for. The terraces are arranged in a mandala pattern visible only from above, said to be based on the flight pattern Rayquaza performed during its legendary visit.

## Notable Establishments

- **Ascending Dragon Inn** (Noboru Ryū Ryokan): A traditional Japanese inn with distinctive floating rooms connected to the main structure by swaying bridges. Each room is designed around a different Dragon or Flying-type Pokémon theme, with architectural elements that accommodate the specific needs of those Pokémon types. The inn's most prestigious suite, the "Rayquaza Room," is built at the highest point and features a retractable ceiling for viewing the stars. The inn is managed by Elder Himiko and her partner Altaria, who personally greet guests with a traditional tea ceremony that includes both human visitors and their Pokémon partners.

- **Wind Whisper Tea House** (Kaze Sasayaki Chaya): A serene establishment specializing in the region's famous cloud tea, harvested from plants that grow only at specific altitudes and processed using gentle heat provided by Charizard's precisely controlled flame. The tea house features open-air seating where customers and their Pokémon can enjoy panoramic views while sampling different tea varieties paired with traditional wagashi sweets. The proprietor, Master Takeshi, is known for his tea reading divinations where he interprets the patterns formed by tea leaves with the assistance of his partner Gothitelle's psychic insights.

- **Scale Craft Workshop** (Uroko Kōgei Kōjō): A collaborative artisan space where humans work alongside Dragon-type Pokémon to create items from naturally shed scales. The workshop produces everything from decorative mosaics to practical items like wind-resistant roofing tiles and special containers that preserve the freshness of mountain herbs. Visitors can participate in guided crafting sessions where they learn to work with dragon scales under the tutelage of skilled artisans and their Pokémon partners. The workshop's masterpiece is the "Eternal Flight" mural that depicts the history of human-Pokémon partnership in the mountains, created entirely from scales donated by local Dragon-types.

- **Tengu Shrine** (Tengu Jinja): A small Shinto-inspired shrine at the village outskirts dedicated to the mountain Yokai Tengu, believed to be the guardians of sacred knowledge. The shrine is tended by a mysterious elderly woman known only as "The Wind Crone" and her unusual partner—a Honchkrow with partially white feathers. Visitors leave offerings of sake, mountain herbs, and small hand-carved gourds in exchange for protection during mountain journeys. The shrine features unusual architecture that incorporates elements resembling both Tengu's traditional depiction and Pokémon like Shiftry and Honchkrow, who are believed to be related to these Yokai spirits.

## Cultural Practices

Summit Village is known for its "Wind Listening" tradition, where residents and their Pokémon partners spend time each day in silent meditation, interpreting the messages carried by mountain winds. The most skilled practitioners can reportedly predict weather changes days in advance and sometimes receive insights about distant events carried by Flying-type Pokémon who unconsciously absorb information during their travels.

The village observes a unique daily rhythm called "Cloud Flow" (Kumo no Nagare), where activities shift with the movement of mountain clouds and winds. This practice, developed through centuries of observing Flying-type Pokémon behavior, creates a natural flow to the day that visitors initially find disorienting but soon come to appreciate for its harmony with natural cycles.

A distinctive feature of village life is the "Sky Script" (Sora no Moji) communication system, where Flying-type Pokémon like Pidgeot and Corviknight create messages in the sky through controlled flight patterns or by carrying special colored streamers. This visual language can be seen for miles across the mountains and serves as an important communication method between isolated settlements.

## Visitor Experience

Visitors are welcomed with the "Wind Greeting" (Kaze no Aisatsu) ceremony, where they receive a small wind chime blessed by the village's Psychic and Flying-type Pokémon. These chimes are said to harmonize the visitor's energy with the mountain's natural rhythms and serve as a symbol of temporary belonging in the community.

Tourists are encouraged to participate in daily meditation sessions and basic flight observation classes, where they learn to interpret the behavior of Flying-type Pokémon as indicators of weather patterns and energy flows. For more adventurous visitors, guided "Sky Walking" tours offer the opportunity to traverse the mountain paths with Flying-type Pokémon guides who can assist if the terrain becomes too challenging.

The village hosts special "Dragon Communion" (Ryū no Kyōdotai) events twice monthly during the new and full moons, where visitors with Dragon-type partners can participate in group meditation sessions designed to deepen the bond between trainer and Pokémon. These sessions are led by a Dragon Sage and their partner—typically an elder Dragonite or Salamence with decades of experience in these practices.

Many visitors report unusual experiences during their stay, such as vivid dreams featuring flight, temporary enhancement of psychic sensitivity, and rare moments of wordless communication with their Pokémon partners. The locals attribute these phenomena to the unique spiritual energy of the mountains and the blessing Rayquaza bestowed on the village centuries ago.
