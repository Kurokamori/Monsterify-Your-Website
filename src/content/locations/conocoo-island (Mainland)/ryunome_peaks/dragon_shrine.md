# Dragon Shrine (Ryū no Hokora 竜の神社)

This sacred complex stands at the convergence of nine dragon veins—natural energy lines that flow through Ryunome Peaks—creating one of the most spiritually significant sites in the region. Built into the face of a sheer cliff that seems to defy conventional architecture, the Dragon Shrine serves as both a place of worship for the legendary Dragon Pokémon and a training ground where humans and their Dragon-type partners seek to achieve the highest levels of harmony and understanding.

## History

According to ancient scrolls maintained by the Dragon Sages, the shrine was established 750 years ago when Rayquaza descended from the sky during a rare celestial alignment. The legendary Pokémon allegedly created a massive updraft that carved out the cliff face, revealing a natural cave system that glowed with draconic energy. The first Dragon Sage, Tenryu, interpreted this as a sign to build a sacred space where humans could commune with Dragon Pokémon.

Over centuries, the shrine expanded as each generation of Dragon Sages and their Pokémon partners added new elements. The most significant expansion occurred 400 years ago when a group of wild Dragonite and Salamence voluntarily joined the shrine community, helping to create the elaborate aerial structures that now extend from the cliff face.

The shrine gained additional significance 267 years ago during the "Great Convergence" when the barrier between dimensions temporarily thinned, allowing contact with the Digital World's Mount Infinity region. During this event, the shrine's central crystal reportedly resonated with digital energy, creating a permanent connection that occasionally allows communication with Digimon like Azulongmon and Examon.

## Features

- **The Nine Dragon Gates** (Kyuu Ryū Mon): A series of torii-inspired gates that mark the approach to the shrine, each representing one of the nine sacred Dragon Pokémon of Ryunome tradition. The gates are carved from stone infused with dragon energy and decorated with scales shed by the respective Pokémon species. As visitors pass through each gate, they're expected to perform a specific meditation gesture that honors that dragon's attributes. The gates are arranged in ascending order of evolutionary complexity: Kingdra (water dragon), Dragapult (ghost dragon), Kommo-o (fighting dragon), Goodra (slimy dragon), Haxorus (axe dragon), Garchomp (land dragon), Salamence (flying dragon), Dragonite (benevolent dragon), and finally Rayquaza (sky dragon).

- **Scale Cascade** (Uroko no Taki): A breathtaking architectural feature where thousands of naturally shed Dragon-type scales are arranged to create a shimmering "waterfall" down the cliff face. The scales are attached to thin wires that allow them to move with the mountain winds, creating a constantly shifting pattern of iridescent colors. Flying-type Pokémon like Altaria and Corviknight maintain the installation, replacing damaged scales with new ones donated by Dragon-types from across the region. The cascade is said to have acoustic properties that transform wind into sounds resembling dragon calls, creating a natural music that changes with the seasons.

- **Dragon Vein Nexus** (Ryūmyaku Kesshōten): The heart of the shrine, a natural cave where nine dragon veins converge, creating a powerful energy that manifests as visible light patterns flowing through the stone. The nexus features a massive crystal similar to a Dragon Gem but much larger, which pulses with energy in rhythm with the mountain's natural flows. Dragon-type Pokémon who meditate here reportedly experience enhanced abilities and deeper connection to their ancestral memories. The cave walls are covered in ancient carvings that combine human language with patterns based on Unown script, telling the history of Dragon Pokémon from their own perspective.

- **Sky Meditation Platforms** (Ten Meiso Dai): A series of wooden platforms that extend outward from the cliff face, suspended over a sheer drop of several thousand feet. These platforms are used for the most advanced meditation practices, where practitioners seek to overcome fear and achieve the mental state necessary for "Dragon Sight." The platforms are reinforced by Psychic-type Pokémon like Metagross and Claydol who provide invisible support, though this fact is not revealed to initiates until after they complete their first meditation. Dragon-type Pokémon often circle these platforms in flight patterns that create updrafts, symbolically supporting the meditators.

- **Scale Library** (Uroko Bunko): A repository of knowledge specific to Dragon-type Pokémon, containing scrolls, tablets, and memory crystals that record information too sensitive or sacred to be kept in public libraries. The collection includes detailed accounts of dragon vein mapping, techniques for communicating with Dragon-types telepathically, and records of rare evolutionary phenomena observed only at the shrine. The library is maintained by a lineage of Psychic/Dragon dual-types like Latios and Latias who serve as both guardians and living repositories of knowledge too dangerous to record physically.

- **Digital Dragon Shrine** (Dejitaru Ryū Hokora): A modern addition to the complex, this small shrine houses a crystal similar to those used in the Digital Nexus in Skyhold. The shrine is dedicated to Digimon like Azulongmon and Examon who share draconic attributes with Pokémon like Rayquaza and Dragonite. During specific astronomical alignments, the crystal activates, allowing limited communication with the Digital World's Mount Infinity region. The shrine is maintained by a partnership between Dragon Sages and Porygon-Z operators who study the connections between draconic energy in both worlds.

- **Yokai Boundary Markers** (Yokai Kyōkai Hyōshiki): A series of stone pillars carved with protective symbols that mark the boundaries between the physical world and the realm of dragon Yokai like Tatsu (dragon spirits) and Mizuchi (water dragons). These markers are tended by Ghost/Dragon dual-types like Dragapult who are believed to be able to perceive and communicate with these spirits. Visitors often leave small offerings of dragon fruit and sake at these markers to ensure safe passage through areas where the boundary is particularly thin.

## Guardian Pokémon

The Dragon Shrine is protected and maintained by several powerful Pokémon who are considered its guardians rather than residents:

- A venerable Dragonite who has lived for over 200 years serves as the primary guardian, coordinating the other protectors and communicating with the Council of Wind and Scale
- A pair of Latios and Latias maintain the psychic barriers that prevent those with harmful intentions from finding the shrine's inner sanctum
- A wise Goodra tends the Scale Cascade, ensuring the proper flow of energy through the dragon scales
- A powerful Salamence patrols the airspace around the shrine, challenging Flying-types who approach without proper authorization

These guardians work closely with the Dragon Sages, humans who have dedicated their lives to understanding and preserving dragon knowledge. The current head of the shrine is Grand Dragon Sage Ryuho, an elderly man whose partner Dragonite is said to be a direct descendant of the first Dragonite to join the shrine community.

## Spiritual Practices

The shrine serves as the center for the "Dragon Path" (Ryū no Michi), one of the three main spiritual traditions in Ryunome Peaks. Practitioners progress through several stages of training:

1. **Scale Initiates** (Uroko no Shoshinsha): Beginners who learn the history and basic meditation techniques
2. **Wind Riders** (Kaze no Norimono): Intermediate practitioners who begin working with Flying/Dragon dual-types
3. **Vein Walkers** (Myaku no Arukite): Advanced students who learn to perceive and navigate dragon veins
4. **Sight Seekers** (Me no Motomete): Those pursuing the ultimate goal of achieving "Dragon Sight"

The most sacred ritual performed at the shrine is the "Scale Communion" (Uroko no Kyōdotai), where humans and their Dragon-type partners enter a deep meditative state while in physical contact with the Dragon Vein Nexus. During this communion, they reportedly experience each other's consciousness, gaining profound understanding of their partner's perspective. Those who achieve the deepest connection may experience "Dragon Sight" (Ryū no Me), a state where they temporarily perceive the world as Dragon-type Pokémon do, seeing energy flows and patterns invisible to normal human perception.

## Visitor Experience

Access to the Dragon Shrine is strictly limited and controlled by the Dragon Sages. Casual tourists are permitted only to view the shrine from designated observation points several hundred meters away, where they can appreciate the Scale Cascade and the architectural achievement of the complex built into the cliff face.

Serious pilgrims and trainers with Dragon-type partners may apply for limited access to the outer shrine by demonstrating their understanding of dragon lore and their bond with their Pokémon. This access includes permission to pass through the Nine Dragon Gates and visit the public meditation platforms, but not to enter the inner sanctum containing the Dragon Vein Nexus.

Full access to the shrine is granted only to those who have been formally accepted as students of the Dragon Path, a process that typically requires years of preparation and the recommendation of a current Dragon Sage. Even then, certain areas like the Scale Library remain restricted to all but the most advanced practitioners.

Visitors granted any level of access are expected to observe strict protocols, including specific purification rituals before entering, maintaining silence except in designated speaking areas, and refraining from any attempt to capture wild Pokémon who reside at the shrine. Dragon-type partners are welcome throughout the complex, but other Pokémon types may be asked to remain in certain areas to maintain the shrine's draconic energy balance.

The optimal time to visit is during the autumn equinox, when the dragon veins are said to be most active and the Scale Cascade displays its most vibrant colors. During this period, the shrine hosts the "Dragon Ascension Ceremony" (Ryū no Shōten Gishiki), where Dragon Sages and their partners perform elaborate flight patterns around the shrine while reciting ancient chants that honor the nine sacred dragons.
