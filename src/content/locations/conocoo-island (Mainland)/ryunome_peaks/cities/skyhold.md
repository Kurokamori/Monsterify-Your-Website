# Skyhold (Sora no Toride 空の砂城)

This magnificent mountain metropolis serves as the capital of Ryunome Peaks, built across a series of interconnected plateaus and seemingly floating cliff edges. With its substantial population of 25,000 humans and approximately 15,000 Pokémon citizens, Skyhold represents the pinnacle of harmony between Japanese/Tibetan mountain architecture and Flying/Dragon/Psychic-type Pokémon integration, creating a city that appears to defy gravity while honoring the sacred connection between earth and sky.

## History

Skyhold was founded 800 years ago when the legendary Dragon Sage Tenryu and his partner Rayquaza discovered a unique convergence of dragon veins—natural energy lines that flow through the mountains. According to ancient scrolls, Rayquaza created a powerful updraft that lifted an entire section of mountainside, forming the floating plateaus that now support the city. The initial settlement was a simple monastery, but over generations, it expanded across multiple plateaus connected by bridges both physical and psychic.

The city experienced a golden age 400 years ago when an alliance was formed with a flock of Altaria and Dragonite, who agreed to help expand and maintain the city's aerial infrastructure in exchange for protection and the creation of sacred nesting grounds. The most significant event in the city's history was the "Great Convergence" 267 years ago, when a rare astronomical alignment allegedly thinned the barrier between dimensions, allowing brief contact with the Digital World's Mount Infinity region. This event is commemorated in the annual Digital Convergence festival.

## City Districts

### Tenryu-ku (Sky Dragon District)

The central administrative district built on the highest plateau, housing the Council of Wind and Scale and major ceremonial spaces:

- **Dragon Spire Palace** (Ryū no Tō Kyuden): The magnificent central pagoda where the Grand Sky Master and Dragon Sages govern the region. The nine-tiered structure features a different Dragon-type theme on each level, with the top floor housing the "Scale Chamber" where the most important decisions are made. The palace's distinctive feature is its constantly shifting roof tiles made from shed Dragonair scales that change color with the weather and time of day. The building is partially supported by Psychic-type Pokémon like Metagross and Claydol who maintain a subtle levitation effect, making the upper tiers appear to float independently of the lower structure.

- **Wind Echo Plaza** (Kaze no Hibiki Hiroba): A vast circular space designed with acoustic properties that amplify and harmonize the mountain winds. The plaza features wind-activated musical instruments played by the natural air currents, creating an ever-changing symphony. Flying-type Pokémon like Altaria and Oricorio often perform aerial dances here, adding their own songs to the wind music. The plaza hosts major ceremonies including the annual Sky Pilgrimage Festival and serves as the starting point for the Nine Peaks Pilgrimage.

- **Rayquaza's Blessing** (Rekkuuza no Shukufuku): A sacred shrine built around a small meteorite believed to have been brought to earth by Rayquaza centuries ago. The shrine is tended by a lineage of Dragon Sages and their Dragonite partners who maintain an eternal flame said to burn with the same green energy as Rayquaza's power. Pilgrims from across the region come to meditate here, seeking insight and connection with the legendary Pokémon.

### Kazehane-ku (Wind Wing District)

The western district dedicated to Flying-type Pokémon and aerial activities:

Human residences are integrated throughout, with homes designed to accommodate both species comfortably.

- **Sky Harmony Academy** (Ten Chōwa Gakuin): The region's premier educational institution where students learn traditional knowledge alongside Pokémon studies. The academy's unique curriculum includes "Sky Writing" (calligraphy practiced in wind currents), "Dragon History" (taught partly through stories passed down by long-lived Dragon-types), and "Wind Mathematics" (calculating flight patterns and wind dynamics). The campus features open-air classrooms where Flying-type Pokémon can participate alongside human students.

- **Wind Messenger Guild** (Kaze no Tsukai Girudo): Headquarters of the elite communication network that connects all settlements in Ryunome Peaks. Guild members and their Flying-type partners train in the "Sky Script" communication system and serve as the region's postal service and emergency response team. The guild hall features a massive aviary with specialized departure and arrival platforms for different Pokémon species, and a weather monitoring center where Psychic-types work with meteorologists to predict mountain conditions.

### Ryuunome-ku (Dragon Eye District)

The eastern district focused on Dragon-type Pokémon and spiritual practices:

- **Scale Library** (Uroko Toshokan): A vast repository of knowledge housed in a spiraling structure resembling a curled dragon. The library contains scrolls and tablets dating back centuries, many written in a script combining human language with patterns based on Unown. The most precious texts are maintained by Psychic/Dragon dual-types like Latios and Latias who can preserve the knowledge psychically even if the physical medium deteriorates. The library's central chamber houses the "Dragon Memory," a psychic construct where the memories of ancient Dragon-types are stored and can be accessed by trained Mind Seers.

- **Nine Dragons Temple** (Kyuu Ryū Jinja): A complex of nine interconnected shrines, each dedicated to one of the sacred Dragon Pokémon of Ryunome tradition: Dragonite, Salamence, Garchomp, Haxorus, Goodra, Kommo-o, Dragapult, Kingdra, and at the center, Rayquaza. The temple is built around a natural dragon vein convergence point, creating a powerful energy that enhances Dragon-type abilities. Dragon Path practitioners come here for advanced training and meditation, seeking to achieve the state of "Dragon Sight."

- **Scale Craft Guildhall** (Uroko Kōgei Kaikan): Center of the region's distinctive dragon scale artistry, where master craftspeople and their Pokémon partners create everything from ceremonial objects to practical items using naturally shed Dragon-type scales. The guildhall features workshops for different specialties, a gallery of masterworks, and training facilities where apprentices learn the ancient techniques. The building itself is a showcase of scale craft, with walls and ceilings covered in intricate mosaics that tell the history of Ryunome Peaks.

### Shinri-ku (Mind District)

The northern district dedicated to Psychic-type Pokémon and mental disciplines:

- **Resonance Chambers** (Kyōmei no Shitsu): A complex of meditation halls designed with sacred geometry that amplifies psychic energies. Each chamber has different properties based on its shape and the materials used in its construction, creating spaces optimized for different types of mental practice. Psychic-type Pokémon like Alakazam and Gardevoir serve as guides and teachers, helping humans develop their latent psychic abilities through meditation and focused exercises.

- **Mind Healers Sanctuary** (Kokoro Iyashi no Sankuchuari): A healing center where traditional medicine is combined with psychic techniques and Pokémon abilities. The sanctuary specializes in treating both physical and psychological conditions through a holistic approach that considers the patient's entire energy system.
