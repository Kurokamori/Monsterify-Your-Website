# Ryunome Peaks (竜の目峰 / Ryū no Me Peaks)

The inhabitants of Ryunome Peaks have developed a rich culture shaped by their symbiotic relationship with Flying, Dragon, and Psychic-type Pokémon, as well as their reverence for the sacred mountains they call home. Their society blends elements of Japanese mountain ascetics (yamabushi), Tibetan Buddhist monasticism, and unique traditions born from centuries of Pokémon partnership, creating a civilization that values harmony with nature, spiritual elevation, and the balance between earth and sky.

## Culture and Society

### Social Structure and Governance

Ryunome Peaks is governed by the Council of Wind and Scale (Kaze to Uroko no Hyōgi-kai), a governing body that combines spiritual leadership with practical administration. The council consists of:

- **Grand Sky Master** (Dai Ten Shi): The spiritual leader who has achieved the highest level of harmony with Flying-type Pokémon, currently Master Hiroshi Kazehane and his partner Dragonite who have led the region for over 40 years

- **Dragon Sages** (Ryū no Kenja): Five elders who have formed deep bonds with different lineages of Dragon-type Pokémon, each representing one of the sacred mountain peaks

- **Wind Abbots** (Kaze no Jūshoku): Leaders of the major monasteries, who work closely with Flying-type Pokémon to maintain communication between settlements

- **Mind Seers** (Kokoro no Kenshi): Mystics with exceptional psychic abilities, enhanced through partnerships with Psychic-type Pokémon like Alakazam and Gardevoir

- **Pokémon Representatives**: A rotating group of elder Pokémon, typically long-lived species like Dragonite and Metagross, who communicate through Psychic-type interpreters

This council makes decisions based on both practical needs and spiritual principles, with the goal of maintaining harmony between humans, Pokémon, and the mountain environment. When conflicts arise, they are resolved through a meditation process called "Wind and Dragon Harmony" (Kaze to Ryū no Chōwa), where all parties meditate together with Psychic-type Pokémon who help facilitate understanding.

Society is organized into three main paths or vocations, each with its own traditions and Pokémon partnerships:

- **Sky Path** (Ten no Michi): Focuses on Flying-type Pokémon partnerships and includes messengers, weather forecasters, and aerial defenders
- **Dragon Path** (Ryū no Michi): Centers on Dragon-type Pokémon relationships and includes scholars, historians, and guardians of ancient knowledge
- **Mind Path** (Kokoro no Michi): Emphasizes Psychic-type Pokémon bonds and includes healers, teachers, and mediators

Many individuals progress through multiple paths during their lifetime, with each transition marked by special ceremonies involving both human and Pokémon communities.

### Daily Life and Customs

Residents begin each day with "Sky Greeting" (Ten no Aisatsu), a meditation practice performed at dawn where humans and their Pokémon partners face the rising sun and perform synchronized breathing exercises. Many families maintain "wind altars" in their homes where small offerings of mountain herbs and berries are left for both legendary Pokémon and local Yokai spirits.

Homes typically feature a "meditation space" (Zen-ba) where family members and their Pokémon partners practice daily mindfulness together. These spaces usually contain a small wind bell that is believed to harmonize the energies of the household and a dragon scale passed down through generations that serves as a focus for meditation.

Children receive their first partner Pokémon through the "Wind Choosing Ceremony" (Kaze no Erabi) when they turn twelve years old. Rather than selecting their Pokémon, they meditate for three days on one of the sacred peaks, and the Pokémon that approaches them during this time is considered their destined partner. This bond is formalized through a ceremony where both child and Pokémon drink from mountain springs blessed by Suicune.

### Cuisine

Ryunome cuisine centers around mountain ingredients prepared with minimal processing to preserve their natural energies. The cooking style emphasizes the five elemental tastes (sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami) in balance, similar to Japanese washoku principles but adapted to high-altitude ingredients. Signature dishes include:

- **Cloud Broth** (Kumo Dashi): Clear soup made from mountain herbs and minerals collected by Flying-type Pokémon from otherwise inaccessible peaks
- **Dragon Scale Rice** (Ryū no Uroko Gohan): Rice cooked with herbs in pots lined with shed Dragon-type scales, giving it a subtle iridescent appearance and enhanced nutritional properties
- **Wind Soba** (Kaze Soba): Buckwheat noodles dried in mountain winds by Pokémon like Pidgeot and Corviknight, creating a unique texture and flavor
- **Peak Vegetables** (Mine no Yasai): Mountain vegetables grown in terraced gardens tended by partnerships between humans and Grass/Flying dual-types like Tropius

Many meals are prepared and consumed as mindfulness practices, with specific rituals for gathering, preparing, and eating food. The most sacred dining tradition is the "Dragon's Meal" (Ryū no Shokuji), where humans and Pokémon eat the same food together in complete silence, focusing on the shared experience and the energy of the ingredients.

### Festivals and Celebrations

- **Sky Pilgrimage Festival** (Ten no Junrei Matsuri): An annual celebration commemorating the legendary first journey of humans to the sacred peaks on the backs of Dragon Pokémon. The highlight is a spectacular aerial display where trainers and their Flying and Dragon-type partners perform synchronized flight patterns that recreate the mythical journey. The festival concludes with the "Dragon's Descent" ceremony, where the Grand Sky Master and their Dragonite partner perform a ritual dive from the highest peak, symbolizing the connection between sky and earth.

- **Wind Harmony Ceremony** (Kaze no Chōwa Gishiki): A spring festival celebrating the changing mountain winds. Flying-type Pokémon create elaborate aerial currents that produce natural music when passing through specially constructed wind instruments built into the mountain architecture. Human musicians join with Pokémon like Chimecho and Kricketune to create complex harmonies that are said to balance the region's energy for the coming season.

- **Scale Shedding Ritual** (Uroko Datsuraku Girei): A private ceremony held when Dragon-type Pokémon shed their scales. The scales are collected and either returned to the Pokémon's personal treasure hoard or donated for use in sacred art and architecture. The most auspicious scales—those shed during a full moon—are preserved for use in coming-of-age ceremonies and healing rituals.

- **Digital Convergence** (Dejitaru Tōgō): A modern festival coinciding with specific astronomical alignments when the barrier between the physical world and the Digital World's Mount Infinity region grows thin. Digimon like Garurumon and Birdramon are said to sometimes appear during this time, and locals leave offerings of data crystals at special shrines maintained by Porygon-Z.

- **Tengu Appeasement Day** (Tengu Nagusameri Bi): A solemn observance held during the autumn equinox, when the mountain Yokai are believed to be most active. Residents wear special masks resembling Shiftry and Honchkrow, Pokémon thought to be related to Tengu spirits, and perform ritual dances at mountain shrines. Flying and Dark-type Pokémon participate in these ceremonies, acting as intermediaries between humans and the Yokai realm.

### Crafts and Arts

- **Wind Calligraphy** (Kaze Shodō): The art of creating characters using special brushes held aloft by controlled gusts from Flying-type Pokémon like Pidgeot and Corviknight

- **Scale Mosaic** (Uroko Mozaiku): Intricate artworks created from naturally shed Dragon-type scales, arranged to capture and reflect light in specific patterns

- **Cloud Weaving** (Kumo Ori): Textile art using fibers collected from plants that grow only in high-altitude cloud forests, often with patterns inspired by the flight paths of local Flying-types

- **Mind Music** (Kokoro no Ongaku): Musical traditions where human musicians perform in telepathic harmony with Psychic-type Pokémon, creating compositions that can be experienced beyond the audible spectrum

- **Dragon Pottery** (Ryū Tōki): Ceramic works fired in kilns heated by Dragon-type Pokémon, creating unique glazes impossible to achieve with conventional firing methods

### Spiritual Beliefs and Practices

The people of Ryunome Peaks practice a spiritual tradition that blends elements of Shinto, Buddhism, and reverence for Pokémon as divine messengers. They believe that the mountains are physical manifestations of ancient Dragon Pokémon who chose to become part of the earth to create homes for both humans and Pokémon.

Their cosmology includes both legendary Pokémon and Yokai spirits:

- Rayquaza is revered as the Supreme Sky Guardian who maintains balance from above
- Lugia is honored as the Diving Wind Spirit who connects the sea and sky
- Dragonite is respected as the Messenger Between Realms who can traverse all elements
- Tengu (mountain Yokai) are viewed as both potential threats and wisdom-bearers, similar to their role in Japanese folklore

Many residents practice "Wind Mind" (Kaze Shin), a meditation technique where they visualize their consciousness as a breeze flowing between peaks. Advanced practitioners can reportedly achieve a state called "Dragon Sight" (Ryū no Me), where they briefly perceive the world as Dragon-type Pokémon do, seeing energy flows and ancient patterns invisible to normal human perception.

The most dedicated spiritual practitioners undertake the "Nine Peaks Pilgrimage" (Kyuu no Mine Junrei), visiting all nine sacred mountains in a specific sequence while performing rituals at each summit. Those who complete this journey are said to receive a blessing from Rayquaza, manifesting as a small green mark somewhere on their body that grants them enhanced harmony with Flying and Dragon-type Pokémon.

### Training and Education

Education in Ryunome Peaks follows a holistic approach that integrates academic knowledge, spiritual development, and Pokémon partnership. Children begin their formal education at age six in "Wind Schools" (Kaze no Gakkō), where they learn alongside young Pokémon in mixed-species classrooms.

The curriculum includes:

- **Sky Writing** (Ten Shoji): Calligraphy and literature, often practiced outdoors where the wind adds an element of challenge and spontaneity
- **Dragon History** (Ryū Rekishi): Study of the region's past through both human records and stories passed down by long-lived Dragon-type Pokémon
- **Mind Harmony** (Kokoro Chōwa): Meditation and psychic development techniques, taught with the assistance of Psychic-type Pokémon
- **Wind Mathematics** (Kaze Sūgaku): Mathematical principles taught through practical applications like calculating wind patterns and flight trajectories
- **Scale Craft** (Uroko Kōgei): Artistic and practical crafts using materials from the mountain environment

At age twelve, children undergo the Wind Choosing Ceremony and begin specialized training based on their Pokémon partner and personal inclinations. Many continue their education at one of the mountain monasteries, where they may spend years developing both their spiritual awareness and their bond with their Pokémon partners.

The most prestigious educational institution is the Sky Harmony Academy (Ten Chōwa Gakuin) in Skyhold, where the most promising students train under the direct guidance of the Dragon Sages and their ancient Pokémon partners, some of whom have lived for centuries through their deep connection to the mountain's energy.

The people of Ryunome Peaks welcome visitors who show respect for local traditions and the sacred mountains. Tourists are encouraged to participate in the "Visitor's Wind" ceremony, where they're taught basic meditation techniques and proper etiquette for interacting with both the human and Pokémon residents of the peaks.
