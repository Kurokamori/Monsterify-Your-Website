# Golden Pagoda Palace

The Golden Pagoda Palace stands as the crown jewel of Avelinora Central City, a breathtaking architectural marvel that blends Southeast Asian design elements with fantasy aesthetics. Its nine golden-tiled tiers rise majestically above the cityscape, each level representing one of the nine virtues revered by the royal lineage. The palace complex encompasses not only the royal residence but also administrative buildings, ceremonial halls, and meticulously landscaped gardens.
