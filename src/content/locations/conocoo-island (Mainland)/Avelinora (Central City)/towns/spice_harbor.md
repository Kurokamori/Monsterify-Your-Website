# Spice Harbor

Spice Harbor is a vibrant port town at the southern edge of Avelinora Central City, drawing inspiration from the coastal trading settlements of the Indian Ocean. This colorful district features architecture reminiscent of South Asian and East African coastal towns, with intricately carved wooden balconies, coral stone buildings painted in vivid colors, and bustling docks where ships from distant lands arrive laden with exotic goods and rare monsters.

## Town Features

- **Central Square**: The Monsoon Plaza, a circular open space paved with intricate stone patterns, surrounded by spice warehouses and trading offices, where seasonal celebrations mark the changing of the trade winds
- **Local Market**: The Aromatic Bazaar, a sensory explosion of colors and scents where merchants sell rare spices, tropical fruits, healing herbs, and ingredients used in monster care and training
- **Community Buildings**: The Navigators' Guild Hall, built from the timbers of historic ships, housing maps, nautical instruments, and records of trading voyages, as well as a school for aspiring sailors and merchants
- **Residential Areas**: A mix of grand merchants' homes with inner courtyards and cooling fountains alongside more modest dwellings, all featuring distinctive carved doors believed to bring prosperity to the inhabitants
- **Surrounding Environment**: Protected harbor coves where fishing boats and trading vessels dock, bordered by mangrove forests that are home to unique water/grass-type monsters that help maintain the coastal ecosystem

Visitors to Spice Harbor can sample fusion cuisine that blends flavors from across the trading world, stay in guest houses with views of the harbor, and participate in the weekly Traders' Fair where merchants showcase their most exotic wares and monster trainers demonstrate techniques from distant lands.
