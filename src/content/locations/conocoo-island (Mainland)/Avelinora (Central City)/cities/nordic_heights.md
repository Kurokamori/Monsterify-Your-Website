# Nordic Heights

Nordic Heights is a majestic city perched on the elevated northern section of Avelinora Central City, drawing inspiration from Scandinavian cultures and aesthetics. With its striking wooden and stone architecture featuring dragon-head carvings, intricate knotwork designs, and sloped roofs to shed snow, this impressive urban center combines rugged practicality with artistic beauty. The city is built on a series of terraced levels connected by grand staircases and funiculars, offering breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape.
