With its colorful buildings in pastel blues, pinks, and yellows, this lively urban center combines the relaxed atmosphere of island life with the dynamic energy of a major trading hub. Palm-lined boulevards lead to pristine beaches where water-type monsters frolic in the crystalline waters of the protected bay.
