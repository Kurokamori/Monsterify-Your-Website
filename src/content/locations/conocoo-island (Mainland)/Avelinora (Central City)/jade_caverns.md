# Jade Caverns

The Jade Caverns form an extensive underground network beneath Avelinora Central City, characterized by their stunning emerald-hued crystalline formations. Drawing inspiration from Chinese mythology and aesthetics, these caverns blend natural wonder with cultural artistry, featuring intricately carved jade pillars and statues of legendary creatures that seem to emerge organically from the cave walls.
