# Shadowfen

Shadowfen is a secretive settlement of approximately 900 residents built within and around the edges of a vast peat bog in the lowlands of Draugmar Hollow. Known for its labyrinthine layout of elevated walkways, partially submerged buildings, and the rare shadow flora that thrives in its murky waters, the town serves as a haven for herbalists, potion-makers, and those seeking to escape notice from the outside world.

## History

Established approximately 350 years ago by a group of herbalists and alchemists exiled from more conventional societies for their experimental practices, Shadowfen began as a collection of huts built on stilts above the bog. The founders discovered that the unique conditions of the fen—particularly the combination of shadow essence that permeates Draugmar Hollow and the nutrient-rich peat—created an environment where rare and powerful plants could thrive.

The settlement grew slowly and deliberately, with new residents accepted only after proving their commitment to the community's values of secrecy, self-sufficiency, and respect for the delicate bog ecosystem. Shadowfen survived the Great Bog Shift of 212 NE, when portions of the fen suddenly sank several feet, by adapting their already-flexible architecture to the changing landscape rather than attempting to control it.

## Notable Locations

- **The Floating Market**: Shadowfen's commercial center consists of dozens of small boats and floating platforms that gather in different configurations each day, connected by temporary rope bridges. Vendors sell rare herbs, potions, preserved specimens, and bog-crafted goods from these mobile shops. The market's location shifts regularly based on bog conditions and the bloom cycles of various aquatic plants, with locals following subtle signs in the water to find the day's gathering point.

- **The Apothecary Collective**: A sprawling complex of interconnected structures built around and within the hollow trunks of massive bog cypress trees. This serves as both a production facility and training center for Shadowfen's renowned herbalists and potion-makers. The complex features specialized growing chambers for different varieties of shadow plants, distillation rooms where the air is thick with aromatic vapors, and testing areas safely isolated from the main settlement. The Collective maintains the most comprehensive herbal library in Draugmar Hollow, with specimens of over 500 bog plants preserved in special shadow-infused solutions.

- **Whispering Reeds Sanctuary**: A natural amphitheater formed by towering reeds that grow in a perfect circle around a small, unusually clear pool. The reeds create an acoustic phenomenon where words spoken at a whisper can be clearly heard throughout the space, while sounds from outside are completely muffled. The sanctuary serves as Shadowfen's gathering place for community decisions, storytelling events, and the performance of bog songs—haunting melodies played on instruments crafted from fen materials. The central pool is said to have oracular properties during certain lunar phases.

- **The Sunken Archives**: A series of waterproof chambers constructed beneath the bog's surface, accessible via hidden entrances that resemble ordinary patches of moss or lily pads. These chambers contain the settlement's most valuable records and secrets, including forbidden alchemical formulas, maps of hidden resources, and the true names and histories of residents who came to Shadowfen seeking new identities. The archives are guarded by specially trained bog divers who can navigate the underwater passages without light.

- **Twilight Boardwalk**: The main residential area consisting of homes built on an elaborate network of elevated walkways that weave between cypress trees and around bog pools. The boardwalk is constructed from a special bog wood that absorbs ambient light during the day and releases a soft glow at night, providing natural illumination that doesn't disturb the nocturnal bog creatures. The homes themselves are built to be easily modified or relocated as the bog shifts, with many incorporating living plants into their structure.

## Culture and Economy

Shadowfen's economy revolves around the harvesting and processing of the unique flora and fauna found in the bog. The town produces highly sought-after medicinal preparations, hallucinogenic compounds, preservatives, dyes, and specialized poisons that are traded discreetly throughout Conocoo Island. Many of these products are available nowhere else, as the plants from which they're derived can only grow in Shadowfen's unique conditions.

The culture emphasizes adaptability, secrecy, and living in harmony with the bog rather than attempting to conquer it. Residents follow a philosophy called "The Way of the Fen," which teaches that strength comes from flexibility and that what appears to be solid ground is often illusion. The community celebrates the Submersion Festival during the autumn equinox, when portions of the boardwalk are intentionally lowered into the bog waters in a symbolic embrace of change and renewal.

## Daily Life

Life in Shadowfen follows the natural rhythms of the bog, with many activities determined by water levels, plant bloom cycles, and the movements of fog banks. Residents begin their day by checking the condition of the walkways near their homes, making necessary repairs or adjustments. Many work as gatherers, venturing into different sections of the bog to harvest plants and other materials, while others process these raw ingredients into valuable products.

Navigation through Shadowfen requires intimate knowledge of the constantly changing landscape. Residents use a complex system of knotted cords, scent markers, and trained bog birds to find their way and communicate locations to others. Children learn to swim before they can walk and are taught to identify safe and dangerous areas of the bog through stories and supervised exploration.

Homes in Shadowfen are typically single-room structures built on adjustable platforms, with walls made of treated reeds and roofs of waterproof bog moss. Most cooking is done communally in designated areas to reduce fire risk, with meals often consisting of bog fish, edible aquatic plants, and preserved foods traded from outside the region.

## Visitor Information

Travelers to Shadowfen should be aware that the settlement does not openly welcome outsiders. Those who wish to visit must either be vouched for by a resident or provide something of value to the community—rare ingredients, useful knowledge, or specialized skills. There are no formal inns, but visitors may be offered accommodation in the Stranger's Roost, a simple structure at the edge of the settlement (5 gold pieces per night as a "contribution" to community resources).

Local cuisine features bog-specific ingredients that may be unfamiliar to outsiders, including shadow carp (a fish with translucent flesh), mist mushrooms (which release a slight numbing effect when consumed), and peat honey (collected from specialized bees that nest in the bog). The signature dish, Fen Stew, contains over twenty different bog plants and is said to grant enhanced night vision for several hours after consumption.

Visitors are strictly prohibited from harvesting anything from the bog without guidance, as many harmless-looking plants are either endangered, toxic, or easily confused with dangerous varieties. All guests are assigned a local guide who remains with them throughout their stay, ostensibly for their safety but also to monitor their activities.

## Governance

Shadowfen operates under a consensus-based system called the Bog Council, consisting of seven elders chosen for their knowledge of different aspects of fen life: herbalism, navigation, construction, preservation, defense, negotiation, and lore. The current Head of Council, Morna Bogwalker, is renowned for her unparalleled knowledge of the fen's hidden pathways and her ability to predict shifts in the bog's landscape.

The council meets weekly in the Whispering Reeds Sanctuary, where any resident may attend and speak. Major decisions require near-unanimous agreement, with deliberations sometimes lasting days for particularly important matters. The settlement has few formal laws, but those that exist—particularly regarding preservation of the bog ecosystem and maintenance of community secrets—are enforced strictly.

Shadowfen maintains minimal official contact with other settlements in Draugmar Hollow, preferring to operate through a network of trusted traders who serve as intermediaries. The town's location is deliberately omitted from most maps, and residents are skilled at misdirecting or discouraging unwanted visitors through a combination of illusion, misinformation, and manipulation of the bog landscape.
