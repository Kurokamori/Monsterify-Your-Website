# Misthollow

Misthollow is an ethereal settlement of approximately 750 residents nestled in a perpetually fog-shrouded valley of Draugmar Hollow. Known for its ghostly beauty and the mysterious mists that weave through its streets, the town has become a haven for seers, spirit mediums, and those who study the veil between worlds. The constant mist creates an otherworldly atmosphere where buildings seem to float and distances become deceptive.

## History

Founded 275 years ago by a group of mystics led by the renowned seer Elara Veilwalker, Misthollow was established at the convergence of several ley lines where the boundary between the material world and spirit realm is unusually thin. The original settlers built the town around seven ancient standing stones that were already present in the valley, believing them to be natural conduits for spiritual energies.

The town gained prominence after the Veil Thinning of 156 NE, when for three days the mists parted to reveal spectral architecture overlapping with the physical buildings. This event attracted scholars of the supernatural from across Conocoo Island and established Misthollow as a center for communion with the spirit world. The town has survived several attempts to "cleanse" it by superstitious outsiders, most notably the Purification Crusade of 203 NE, which was thwarted when the attackers became hopelessly lost in the defensive mists conjured by the town's residents.

## Notable Locations

- **The Veil Plaza**: The town's central square built around the largest of the seven ancient standing stones. The plaza is paved with stones that subtly change color with the phases of the moon and is often filled with swirling mists that seem to move with purpose. Town gatherings, spiritual ceremonies, and the weekly Spectral Market are held here. The central monolith is covered in runes that glow faintly at night and is said to whisper to those with the gift of spiritual sensitivity.

- **Whisperwind Chantry**: A circular temple constructed of pale stone and frosted glass where spirit mediums conduct séances and communion rituals. The building's unique acoustic properties cause even the slightest whisper to carry throughout the chamber while somehow remaining private to the intended listener. The chantry's central chamber contains the Mist Font, a pool of water that never evaporates and is said to show visions of the past or future to those pure of intention.

- **The Drifting Market**: Unlike conventional markets, Misthollow's marketplace has no fixed location. Vendors set up their stalls wherever the morning mists are thinnest, believing this indicates favorable spiritual energies for the day. Shoppers must follow special mist lanterns that guide them to the day's market location. The market specializes in divination tools, spirit communication devices, and materials harvested from the mist itself.

- **Shrouded Academy**: A school for those with psychic and spiritual gifts, housed in a complex of buildings that appear to be partially transparent in certain lights. The academy teaches techniques for communicating with spirits, reading omens, and navigating the treacherous spiritual landscape of Draugmar Hollow. The library contains one of the most comprehensive collections of texts on spectral phenomena, with some books allegedly written by spirits themselves.

- **The Phantom Orchards**: Groves of unusual trees that thrive in the misty environment and produce ghostly white fruits that seem to glow from within. These "phantom fruits" are prized for their ability to enhance spiritual sensitivity when consumed and form the base of many local elixirs and potions. The orchards are tended by specialized gardeners who can sense the trees' needs without verbal communication.

## Culture and Economy

Misthollow's economy centers on spiritual services, divination, and the harvesting of unique resources from the ever-present mists. The town produces specialized items like mist crystals (which capture and store prophetic visions), spectral glass (which can reveal invisible entities), and phantom fruit preserves (which enhance spiritual awareness). These goods are traded throughout Conocoo Island, though many customers never visit Misthollow themselves due to its unsettling reputation.

The culture revolves around harmony with the spirit world and the belief that the mists serve as both protection and connection to realms beyond. Residents practice a form of ancestor veneration, maintaining small shrines in their homes where they communicate with family spirits. The town observes numerous festivals tied to spiritual events, with the most important being the Parting of the Veil celebration that commemorates the town's founding and the Mist Communion, held during the winter solstice when the boundary between worlds is believed to be at its thinnest.

## Daily Life

Life in Misthollow follows rhythms dictated more by spiritual omens than by conventional time. Residents begin each day with a ritual called "Reading the Mists," observing the patterns in the morning fog to determine auspicious activities for the hours ahead. Many businesses open and close based on these readings rather than fixed schedules.

Navigation through the town requires specialized knowledge, as conventional maps are useless in the ever-changing mists. Residents use a combination of mist lanterns, spirit guides, and intuitive pathfinding to move about. Children are taught these skills from an early age, playing games that hone their ability to sense direction in the fog. Homes are built with numerous windows and light wells to maximize natural illumination, with architecture that often incorporates wind chimes and hollow tubes that create ethereal music as the mists flow through them.

## Visitor Information

Travelers to Misthollow should prepare for the disorienting effects of the perpetual mist. Accommodations range from the modest Shrouded Traveler Inn (7 gold pieces per night) to the luxurious Veil Retreat (30 gold pieces per night), which offers rooms designed to enhance dream visions and spiritual experiences.

Local cuisine features phantom fruits, mushrooms that grow only in misty conditions, and herbs with subtle psychoactive properties that "open the third eye." The signature dish, Seer's Broth, is a clear soup that changes flavor with each spoonful and is said to provide glimpses of possible futures to those who consume it mindfully.

Visitors are strongly advised to hire a local guide, as the mists can be treacherous to those unfamiliar with their patterns. The town offers "mist tethers" – enchanted cords that help prevent travelers from becoming lost – available for rent at the town entrance. Those with a sensitivity to spiritual energies may experience unusual dreams, visions, or a sense of being watched while in Misthollow, which residents consider normal and even beneficial.

## Governance

Misthollow is governed by the Council of Seers, seven individuals chosen not through election but by spiritual divination. When a council position becomes vacant, candidates undergo the Mist Trial, entering a specially prepared chamber filled with concentrated mist where they receive visions. The council then interprets these visions to determine who has been "chosen" by the spirits to serve.

The current High Seer, Lysander Mistweaver, has led the council for an unprecedented twenty years, having received visions of unprecedented clarity during his Mist Trial. The council meets during the new moon in a chamber built at the exact center of the seven standing stones, where they commune with spiritual advisors before making significant decisions.

The town maintains limited contact with other settlements in Draugmar Hollow, preferring isolation that preserves their spiritual practices. However, they maintain a network of mystic contacts throughout the region who provide warning of threats and facilitate trade of their unique goods. Misthollow enforces few conventional laws, instead relying on spiritual guidance and community consensus to resolve disputes.
