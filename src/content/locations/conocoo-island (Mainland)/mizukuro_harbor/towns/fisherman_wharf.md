# Fisherman Wharf (Ryoshi no Futoba 漁師の船場)

This charming coastal town serves as a community hub for water Pokémon trainers and fishing families, offering visitors a glimpse into the harmonious relationship between humans and aquatic creatures. With its distinctive Japanese fishing village character and Pokémon-integrated amenities, it provides both necessities for residents and fascinating points of interest for travelers.

## History

Founded over three centuries ago by a legendary Pokémon trainer known as "Suijin no Masuta" (Master of Water) who could communicate with Kyogre, the town began as a simple collection of fishing huts. According to local legend, the founder's partner Pokémon—a wise Slowking—taught the villagers sustainable fishing practices that allowed humans and water Pokémon to thrive together. The distinctive curved harbor was allegedly created by a benevolent Gyarados who reshaped the coastline to protect the village from tsunamis.

## Town Features

- **Mizu no Hiroba** (Water Plaza): The heart of community activity featuring a central fountain where Pokémon and humans gather. The fountain contains a crystal similar to a Water Stone that glows during full moons, attracting rare water Pokémon. Local Pokémon like Marill and Wooper often play in the shallow pools, interacting freely with visitors. The plaza is watched over by a statue of Suijin no Masuta and his Slowking partner.

- **Umi no Ichiba** (Sea Market): A bustling fish market where fishermen and their partner Pokémon sell their daily catch. Machoke and Hariyama help move heavy crates, while Psychic-type Pokémon like Alakazam ensure fair weighing of goods. The market features special sections where Pokémon themselves trade items they've found in the ocean depths. A popular attraction is the "Magikarp Jump" competition held every morning, where fishermen's Magikarp compete for height and style points.

- **Kappa-dera Temple**: A small Shinto-inspired shrine dedicated to both the Yokai Kappa and Pokémon like Ludicolo and Lombre who share similarities with the cucumber-loving water spirit. The temple pond is home to specially bred Lotad whose lily pads are used in purification ceremonies. Visitors can participate in the "Cucumber Offering" ritual, where they leave cucumbers at the shrine in exchange for good luck charms made from Corsola branches.

- **Mizumura** (Water Village): Residential area built on stilts over the water, connected by wooden bridges and populated by families who specialize in different water Pokémon breeding techniques. Each house features distinctive colored flags indicating which Pokémon type the family specializes in. Many homes have underwater sections where human family members can observe their aquatic Pokémon partners in their natural environment through special glass windows.

- **Suijin no Mori** (Water God Forest): A sacred mangrove forest at the edge of town where Pokémon like Feraligatr and Swampert live in a protected sanctuary. The forest is tended by members of the Mori no Kai (Forest Guild) who work with Grass/Water dual-type Pokémon like Ludicolo to maintain the delicate ecosystem. At the center of the forest stands the ancient "Whispering Willow," a massive tree said to have been planted by Celebi during a rare visit, where Pokémon go to evolve in a natural setting.

## Notable Establishments

- **Kairyu Inn** (Dragon Sea Inn): A traditional Japanese ryokan where each room features a unique water Pokémon theme. The inn's onsen (hot spring) is heated by friendly Chinchou and Lanturn who regulate the temperature. Guests can request a "Pokémon Sleep Companion" service where gentle Pokémon like Azumarill or Seel join them for the night, providing soothing sounds or cooling effects.

- **Mizutaki Restaurant**: A specialty restaurant serving hot pot dishes prepared tableside by chefs working alongside Pokémon partners. Octillery help prepare the broth with precise water gun techniques, while Crabrawler crack shellfish with expert precision. The signature dish is "Gyarados Nabemono," a spicy blue hot pot said to grant the courage of a Gyarados to anyone who finishes it.

- **Yokai Mask Shop**: A traditional crafts store selling hand-carved masks representing water Yokai and Pokémon, used in local festivals and as protective household talismans. The elderly owner claims to be part Yokai himself and tells visitors which mask would best protect their home based on their aura, which he says his Mimikyu assistant helps him see.

Visitors will find the town exceptionally welcoming, as the local philosophy of "Mizu no Kokoro" (Water Heart) emphasizes adaptability and acceptance. Many travelers report unusual experiences during their stay, such as prophetic dreams involving water Pokémon or glimpses of rare Yokai during misty mornings—experiences the locals simply accept with knowing smiles.
