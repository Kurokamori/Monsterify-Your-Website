# Harborview (Minato no Mieru Oka 港の見える丘)

This major urban center serves as the capital of Mizukuro Harbor region, blending traditional Japanese architecture with modern innovations designed for Pokémon cohabitation. With its substantial population of 75,000 humans and approximately 40,000 Pokémon residents, Harborview represents one of the most successful examples of human-Pokémon integration in the known world, further enriched by the presence of Digital World portals and Yokai spiritual sites.

## History

Harborview was founded 500 years ago when a massive Wailord, said to be a messenger of Kyogre, guided a fleet of fishing boats to safety during a terrible storm. The grateful sailors established a settlement on the hill overlooking the natural harbor, building the first Mizugami Shrine to honor the water Pokémon that saved them. Over centuries, the city grew as a center for trade between humans and water-dwelling Pokémon, with architectural and cultural influences from both worlds shaping its unique character.

The city experienced a transformation 150 years ago when a mysterious digital distortion appeared in the harbor, creating the first stable portal to the Digital World's Ocean Zone. This event, known as "Dejitaru Kaikou" (Digital Sea Meeting), brought Digimon like MarineAngemon and Plesiomon into contact with the physical world, adding another layer to the city's already diverse ecosystem.

## City Districts

### Nami no Chūō (Wave Center)

The bustling downtown district built around a massive circular harbor where humans, Pokémon, and occasionally Digimon conduct business and socialize. The district features:

- **Umi no Ekō-dōmu** (Sea Echo Dome): A massive glass and steel structure resembling a Tentacruel, housing government offices where human officials work alongside Pokémon advisors like Slowking and Oranguru. The dome's central chamber uses water-amplified acoustics to allow water Pokémon to participate in governance discussions from pools built into the floor.

- **Kaisui Depato** (Seawater Department Store): A twelve-story commercial center with underwater shopping levels for aquatic Pokémon, featuring specialized shops selling items like water-resistant TMs, evolution stones, and custom Poké Balls designed by local artisans.

- **Digital Harbor Terminal**: A high-security facility surrounding the stable Digital World portal, where researchers study the connection between worlds and monitor visiting Digimon. The terminal features a distinctive spiral design inspired by Whirlpool Islands.

### Yokai Yama (Spirit Mountain)

The traditional district built on the hillside overlooking the harbor, known for its ancient shrines and spiritual significance:

- **Grand Mizugami Shrine**: The city's most important religious site, dedicated to Kyogre, Lugia, and Suicune. The shrine's inner sanctum houses a mysterious blue orb said to resonate with Kyogre's power. Shrine maidens work alongside Psychic-type Pokémon like Gardevoir to perform purification rituals.

- **Yokai Street**: A narrow, lantern-lit street where shops sell traditional charms and spiritual items. Many businesses are run by individuals claiming partial Yokai ancestry, and some shops are known to appear and disappear depending on the lunar cycle. The street is home to numerous Gastly and Misdreavus who are considered protective spirits rather than pests.

- **Kitsune Garden**: A traditional Japanese garden where Ninetales and Vulpix are considered sacred messengers. The garden's maple trees turn a distinctive blue-white color in autumn, allegedly due to the influence of Ice-type Vulpix brought from distant northern regions centuries ago.

### Suijin Gakuen (Water God Academy)

The educational district centered around the prestigious Pokémon training academy:

- **Mizukuro Trainer Academy**: Elite school where students learn to work with water Pokémon, featuring specialized training pools, battle arenas with variable water levels, and research facilities. The academy is known for its distinctive graduation ceremony where new trainers and their partner Pokémon dive together from the Academy Cliffs to symbolize their bond.

- **Kaisei Library**: Massive repository of knowledge containing underwater reading rooms where aquatic Pokémon can access information. The library is maintained by a team of Porygon who digitize ancient scrolls and a venerable Alakazam said to have memorized every book in the collection.

- **Dejitaru Kenkyujo** (Digital Research Institute): Facility dedicated to studying Digimon and the Digital World, featuring technology that allows limited data conversion between physical and digital matter. Researchers work closely with Porygon-Z and Rotom to develop new communication methods with digital entities.

### Mizu no Mirai (Water Future)

The modern technological district showcasing innovations in human-Pokémon collaborative technology:

- **Marine Pokémon Research Center**: Cutting-edge facility where scientists work with Water-type Pokémon to develop new technologies. Current projects include sustainable energy generation with Lanturn, weather prediction systems using Lugia's aerodynamic principles, and water purification techniques inspired by Suicune's abilities.

- **Kaishin Tower**: A spiraling skyscraper with a design based on Drednaw's shell pattern, housing tech companies that develop Pokémon-compatible software and hardware. The tower features a massive aquarium core where aquatic Pokémon employees can easily move between floors.

## Cultural Institutions

- **Umi no Rekishi Hakubutsukan** (Sea History Museum): Chronicles the shared history of humans and water Pokémon, featuring fossils of ancient species like Relicanth and Tirtouga alongside artifacts showing how fishing communities evolved to work with Pokémon partners.

- **Mizukagami Theater**: Performance venue where water ballet shows feature synchronized routines between human dancers and Pokémon like Primarina and Milotic. The theater's unique stage can transform from solid ground to shallow pools in seconds.

- **Yokai-Pokémon Comparative Studies Center**: Academic institution dedicated to studying the relationships and similarities between traditional Yokai and Pokémon, featuring exhibits that show how creatures like Froslass and Yuki-onna share cultural origins.

## Transportation

Harborview's transportation system is fully integrated with Pokémon partners:

- **Lapras Ferry Service**: Network of water routes served by trained Lapras and Wailord who transport passengers between districts

- **Pidgeot Sky Taxi**: Aerial transportation provided by Flying-type Pokémon for rapid transit across the city

- **Abra Teleportation Stations**: Limited teleportation service for priority travel, operated by a family of Alakazam

- **Rotom Rail**: Automated light rail system powered and operated by specialized Rotom who have integrated with the train infrastructure

The city welcomes visitors with various accommodation options, including the famous "Mizukami Onsen Ryokan," a traditional inn where hot springs are maintained at perfect temperatures by Volcanion's steam, and the ultra-modern "Kyogre Blue Hotel" with its underwater guest rooms where visitors can sleep surrounded by marine Pokémon in their natural habitat.
