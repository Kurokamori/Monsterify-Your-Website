# Mizukuro Harbor (水黒港)

The architecture of Mizukuro Harbor is characterized by traditional Japanese design elements infused with mystical Pokémon and Yokai influences. This coastal region, whose name translates to "Black Water Harbor," features buildings and structures that showcase distinctive features evolved over generations, creating a harmonious blend of the practical and the spiritual.

## Key Architectural Features

- **Torii-Inspired Gateways**: Massive red and black torii gates mark important harbor entrances and spiritual boundaries, many carved with Gyarados and Milotic motifs that appear to come alive during high tide. Local legend claims these gates were built by ancient Machamp and Conkeldurr Pokémon working alongside human craftsmen.

- **Pagoda Lighthouses**: Multi-tiered pagoda structures serve as lighthouses, with each level housing different water-type Pokémon caretakers. The top levels contain special crystals said to be evolved from Staryu cores that emit powerful, far-reaching light beams. During storms, locals claim to see Lanturn and Chinchou adding their bioluminescence to strengthen the warning lights.

- **Engawa Walkways**: Covered wooden walkways similar to traditional Japanese engawa connect buildings along the waterfront, designed with special water-repellent wood treated by Shiftry craftsmen. These walkways feature protective Suicune and Vaporeon carvings at regular intervals.

- **Sliding Panel Architecture**: Buildings utilize fusuma (sliding doors) and shoji (paper screens) that can be reconfigured based on weather conditions or harbor activities. Many feature hand-painted scenes of legendary water Pokémon and Yokai like Kappa and Ningyo (Japanese merfolk).

- **Mizugami Shrines**: Small Shinto-inspired shrines dedicated to water spirits and legendary water Pokémon dot the harbor. These shrines feature miniature pools where offerings can be left for Yokai water guardians like the Kappa and for Pokémon like Lugia and Kyogre who are believed to control the tides.

- **Living Architecture**: Some structures incorporate specially trained Tangrowth and Ferrothorn Pokémon whose vines are guided to create living supports and natural barriers against storm surges. These "living buildings" are tended by specialized gardeners who have formed symbiotic relationships with grass/water dual-type Pokémon.

- **Lantern Districts**: Neighborhoods illuminated by paper lanterns containing specially bred miniature Chinchou and Mareep that provide sustainable lighting. During festivals, these lanterns are released over water in ceremonies honoring the legendary Yokai Umibozu (sea monk) and the Pokémon Kyogre.

## Distinctive Construction Techniques

Mizukuro's buildings employ traditional Japanese joinery techniques that use no nails, allowing structures to flex during storms or minor earthquakes. Master carpenters work alongside Gallade and Bisharp Pokémon, whose precision cutting abilities are essential for the most intricate joints. Roofs are typically tiled in blue-black ceramic created by local artisans who incorporate scales shed by Gyarados and Milotic into the clay, giving the tiles a subtle iridescent quality and enhanced weather resistance.

Visitors to the region will notice how the built environment harmonizes with the natural landscape while serving the practical needs of the community. Buildings seem to emerge organically from the terrain, with boundaries between human construction and Pokémon habitats often deliberately blurred to encourage coexistence.
