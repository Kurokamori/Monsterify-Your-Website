# Lighthouse Point (Todai Misaki 灰台岐)

This sacred promontory serves as both a navigational beacon for ships and a spiritual nexus where the boundaries between the human world, the Pokémon world, and the realm of Yokai grow thin. The distinctive pagoda lighthouse, with its glowing crystal core, stands as one of Mizukuro Harbor's most recognizable landmarks and a testament to the harmonious relationship between humans, Pokémon, and spiritual entities.

## History

According to local legend, Lighthouse Point was created when a massive Lugia rescued a sinking ship by carrying a massive boulder from the ocean floor and placing it at the harbor entrance as a warning to future sailors. The first lighthouse was built 400 years ago after a Lanturn led a group of shipwrecked sailors to safety during a terrible storm. In gratitude, the survivors constructed a shrine that eventually evolved into the current pagoda lighthouse.

The site gained additional significance 150 years ago during the "Dejitaru Kaikou" event when digital energy from the newly formed portal to the Digital World's Ocean Zone enhanced the lighthouse crystal, giving it the ability to be seen not only across the physical world but also into the Digital World and the spirit realm of Yokai.

## Features

- **Hikari no Pagoda** (Light Pagoda): A seven-tiered pagoda lighthouse constructed from rare blue-white stone quarried from underwater caves. Each level represents one of the seven evolutionary families of Water-type starter Pokémon (Squirtle, Totodile, Mudkip, Piplup, Oshawott, Froakie, and Sobble). The pagoda's distinctive blue flame is maintained by a rotating staff of Fire/Water dual-type Pokémon like Volcanion who work in shifts alongside human lighthouse keepers.

- **Eterna-Crystal**: At the heart of the lighthouse sits a massive crystal similar to a Water Stone but with unusual properties. The crystal is said to have been formed from the tears of Lugia and purified by Suicune's presence. It emits a distinctive blue-white light that can penetrate even the densest fog and is visible from up to 50 miles away. Water-type Pokémon are naturally drawn to the crystal's energy, and many make pilgrimages to the lighthouse at least once in their lifetime.

- **Yokai Viewing Platform**: A circular observation deck at the lighthouse's fifth level is known as a place where the veil between worlds is thinnest. Visitors often report seeing shadowy figures of Yokai like Umibozu (sea monks) and Funayurei (ship ghosts) during foggy evenings. The platform features special telescopes developed with Porygon technology that can occasionally glimpse into the Digital World when conditions are right.

- **Mizugami Shrine**: A small Shinto-inspired shrine at the base of the lighthouse dedicated to Lugia, Kyogre, and Manaphy. The shrine is tended by a family of shrine maidens who work alongside Psychic-type Pokémon like Slowking and Golduck. Visitors can purchase special protective amulets blessed by both the maidens and their Pokémon partners, said to grant safe passage over water.

- **Digimon Observation Post**: A modern addition to the lighthouse complex, this research station monitors the nearby Digital World portal. Researchers work with Porygon-Z and occasionally visiting Digimon like MarineAngemon to study the fluctuations between worlds. The post features a unique communication system that can send simple messages into the Digital World.

- **Whispering Tide Pools**: Natural rock formations at the base of the point create tide pools where rare Water/Psychic dual-type Pokémon like Starmie and Slowking gather to meditate. Visitors who sit quietly beside these pools sometimes receive prophetic visions or insights, especially during the full moon. Local tradition holds that any wish made at these pools during the highest tide of the year will be carried to Kyogre by the Wishiwashi that school in the area.

## Lighthouse Keepers

The lighthouse is maintained by the Mizubeacon family, who have served as keepers for fifteen generations. The current head keeper, Elder Mizubeacon, is rumored to be part Yokai himself, as he can communicate directly with both Water-type Pokémon and sea spirits. He lives in the keeper's cottage with his partner Ampharos (who helps power the lighthouse during emergencies) and a small Drizzile who is training to eventually evolve and take over lighthouse duties.

The keepers follow ancient rituals to maintain the harmony between worlds, including the monthly "Hikari Purification" ceremony where the Eterna-Crystal is cleansed with water blessed by Alolan Ninetales and Primarina.

## Visitor Experience

Visitors can climb the lighthouse daily between sunrise and sunset, with special nighttime viewing available during full moons. The climb consists of 151 steps (said to represent the original 151 Pokémon discovered), with rest platforms at each level featuring educational displays about different Water-type Pokémon and their role in maritime safety.

The lighthouse gift shop sells miniature replicas of the Eterna-Crystal that glow softly in the dark, as well as special "Lighthouse Lure" fishing charms that supposedly attract friendly Pokémon when used in nearby waters. The most coveted souvenir is the "Lugia's Feather Pen," made from feathers naturally shed by Lugia during their rare visits to the point and said to bring inspiration to writers.

Many visitors report unusual experiences during their visit, such as hearing distant Pokémon songs carried on the wind, glimpsing shadowy Yokai figures in peripheral vision, or feeling a strange resonance with their Water-type Pokémon partners. The lighthouse keepers simply smile at such reports, considering them a sign that the visitor has been accepted by the spirits of Lighthouse Point.
