# Ice Fortress (Isfestning)

This imposing military stronghold stands as the ultimate defensive position in Skeljord Glacier, a massive structure built from a combination of glacier ice, ancient stone, and living Pokémon architecture. Positioned at a strategic mountain pass that serves as the only land route into the region from the south, the Ice Fortress represents the pinnacle of Norse-inspired defensive design enhanced by Ice and Steel-type Pokémon abilities.

## History

The Ice Fortress was constructed 600 years ago during the "War of Frozen Tears," when invaders from warmer regions attempted to claim Skeljord's unique resources. According to the Saga of Ice and Steel, the fortress was built in a single winter by an alliance of human warriors and Ice-type Pokémon led by the legendary Battle Jarl Ragnar Frostaxe and his partner Mamoswine.

The initial structure was a simple wall, but over centuries it evolved into a complex fortress with multiple defensive layers. The most significant expansion occurred after the Great Freeze 267 years ago, when Kyurem's influence permanently lowered regional temperatures, allowing for more elaborate ice architecture.

The fortress has never fallen to external attack, though it was temporarily abandoned during the "Burning Winter" 150 years ago when a rogue Fire-type Pokémon army led by a particularly powerful Heatran melted portions of the outer walls. The fortress was quickly reclaimed and rebuilt with improved defenses specifically designed to counter Fire-type threats.

## Features

- **The Great Ice Wall** (Den Store Ismur): The primary defensive structure, a massive wall of glacier ice 200 feet tall and 50 feet thick, reinforced with stone and living Avalugg who have voluntarily integrated themselves into the structure. The wall is maintained by a specialized guild of Ice-type Pokémon and their human partners who continuously repair and strengthen it. The most remarkable feature is the wall's ability to "heal" itself through the coordinated efforts of Bergmite colonies who can sense structural weaknesses and address them before they become problematic.

- **Frost Gate** (Frostporten): The only passage through the Great Ice Wall, a massive gate carved from ancient blue ice and reinforced with "frost steel" (a special alloy created through the combined efforts of Fire and Ice-type Pokémon). The gate is operated by a complex system of counterweights managed by Metagross and Copperajah. Defensive features include channels that can be quickly flooded and frozen by Pokémon like Lapras and Glaceon to seal the gate in emergencies, and runestones carved with protective symbols that resonate with Ice-type energy.

- **Watchtowers of the Nine Realms** (Ni Rikers Vakttårn): A series of nine towers positioned along the wall, each named after one of the Nine Realms from Norse mythology and dedicated to a different defensive strategy. The towers are manned by specialized defensive units consisting of both human warriors and partner Pokémon:
  - **Asgard Tower**: Command center staffed by Psychic-types like Gothitelle who coordinate defense
  - **Vanaheim Tower**: Healing center where Audino and Blissey treat wounded defenders
  - **Alfheim Tower**: Archery platform where Flying-types like Decidueye launch ranged attacks
  - **Midgard Tower**: Main barracks for human defenders and their partner Pokémon
  - **Jotunheim Tower**: Ice Pokémon stronghold where Avalugg and Mamoswine prepare for battle
  - **Niflheim Tower**: Weather control station where Pokémon like Abomasnow can trigger defensive blizzards
  - **Muspelheim Tower**: Surprisingly, home to Fire-type Pokémon like Darmanitan who serve as a counter to Ice-type attackers
  - **Svartalfheim Tower**: Forge and workshop where weapons and armor are repaired during sieges
  - **Helheim Tower**: Prison for captured enemies, guarded by Ghost-type Pokémon like Froslass

- **Bifrost Bridge** (Bifrostbroen): A spectacular rainbow-colored ice bridge spanning a deep chasm behind the wall, serving as a secondary defensive position if the wall is breached. The bridge is maintained by Alolan Ninetales whose Aurora Veil abilities create the distinctive coloration. The bridge can be instantly destroyed by a coordinated Ice Beam attack from defender Pokémon if enemies attempt to cross.

- **Odin's Eye** (Odins Øye): A massive crystal observatory at the highest point of the fortress, where Psychic-type Pokémon like Beheeyem and Gothitelle monitor the surrounding territory for threats. The crystal is said to have been created from the frozen tear of Kyurem and allows those with psychic abilities to see great distances even through blizzards. The observatory is connected to a network of smaller crystals positioned throughout the region that serve as early warning systems.

- **Digital Boundary Monitors** (Digitale Grensemonitorer): A modern addition to the fortress, these specialized devices maintained by Porygon-Z can detect disturbances in the barrier between the physical world and the Digital World. The monitors were installed after an incident 50 years ago when Digimon from the Freezeland region temporarily crossed over during a powerful magnetic storm, causing confusion among defenders who couldn't determine if they were facing Pokémon or something else.

## The Frost Guard

The fortress is defended by an elite military force known as the Frost Guard (Frostvakten), consisting of the region's most accomplished warrior trainers and their partner Pokémon. Unlike traditional Pokémon trainers who command from a distance, Frost Guard members fight alongside their Pokémon partners, using weapons and armor that complement their Pokémon's abilities.

The Guard is organized into specialized units based on Pokémon types:

- **Ice Shields** (Isskjold): Defensive specialists partnered with Pokémon like Avalugg and Glalie
- **Frost Blades** (Frostblad): Offensive units with partners like Weavile and Beartic
- **Storm Ravens** (Stormravn): Aerial units mounted on Flying-types like Corviknight and Braviary
- **Rune Speakers** (Runesnakker): Tactical support using Psychic-types like Gothitelle and Beheeyem
- **Flame Keepers** (Flammebevarere): Specialists in countering Ice-type threats, using Fire-types like Darmanitan

The current commander of the Frost Guard is Battle Jarl Sigurd Stormhammer, a legendary trainer whose partner Mamoswine is said to be a direct descendant of Ragnar Frostaxe's original partner.

## Cultural Significance

Beyond its military purpose, the Ice Fortress serves important cultural functions in Skeljord society:

- It hosts the annual "Warrior's Proving" (Krigerprøven), where young trainers demonstrate their battle skills and bond with their Pokémon partners
- The fortress walls contain the "Saga Halls" (Sagahallene), where the history of the region is carved into ice panels that are maintained and updated by Ice/Psychic-type Pokémon
- The "Oath of Frost and Steel" (Eden av Frost og Stål), the most solemn vow in Skeljord culture, can only be properly sworn at the fortress's central runestone

## Visitor Experience

Despite its military nature, portions of the Ice Fortress are open to visitors who follow strict protocols. Tourists must be accompanied by an official guide at all times and are restricted to designated areas. The most popular attractions include:

- The Wall Walk, where visitors can traverse a section of the Great Ice Wall and view the surrounding glacier landscape
- The Saga Halls, where the region's history is displayed in elaborate ice carvings
- The Bifrost Bridge, famous for its rainbow colors and spectacular views of the chasm below
- The Frost Guard demonstrations, where elite trainers and their Pokémon partners showcase battle techniques

Visitors are advised that security is taken extremely seriously, and unauthorized photography or attempts to access restricted areas will result in immediate expulsion. The fortress is most accessible during the "Thaw Season" in late spring, when temperatures are slightly more tolerable for those unaccustomed to extreme cold.

Many visitors report an unusual sense of security and strength while within the fortress walls, which local guides attribute to the psychic resonance of centuries of defensive energy focused in one location. Pokémon brought by visitors often display increased defensive capabilities while at the fortress, an effect that typically fades within days of departure.
