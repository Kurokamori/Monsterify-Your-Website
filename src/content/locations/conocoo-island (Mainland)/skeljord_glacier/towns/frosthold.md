# Frosthold (Frostholde)

This resilient settlement serves as a vital community hub for the Skeljord Glacier region, carved partially into the glacier itself and built with massive timber longhouses that defy the eternal winter. With its distinctive Norse-inspired architecture and deep integration with Ice and Fighting-type Pokémon, Frosthold offers visitors a glimpse into the warrior culture and survival traditions that define life in this harsh frontier.

## History

Founded over 400 years ago by the legendary warrior Bjorn Isbreaker and his partner Beartic, Frosthold began as a simple hunting outpost. According to local sagas, Bjorn discovered a natural hot spring beneath the glacier and made a pact with a colony of Bergmite and Avalugg to help build a permanent settlement around it. The Pokémon agreed to form living ice walls to protect against blizzards in exchange for protection from predators and access to the nutritious minerals in the hot springs.

The town survived the Great Freeze of 267 years ago when Kyurem allegedly passed through the region, permanently lowering temperatures by several degrees. Rather than abandoning the settlement, the inhabitants adapted by developing deeper partnerships with Ice-type Pokémon and creating the underground hot spring network that remains the town's lifeblood today.

## Town Features

- **Allting Square** (Alltingsplass): The heart of community activity, featuring a massive circular plaza carved from blue glacier ice and surrounded by runestones marking important events in the town's history. At the center stands the "Eternal Flame" (Evigflammen), a fire kept burning continuously for over 300 years through the combined efforts of Fire-type Pokémon like Darmanitan and Heatmor working in shifts. The square hosts weekly community gatherings, battle tournaments, and the seasonal Allting assemblies where all citizens (human and Pokémon) can voice concerns to the local Jarl Council.

- **Frost Market** (Frostmarked): An open-air market despite the harsh climate, protected by a dome of psychic energy maintained by a family of Mr. Mime and Jynx who have served the town for generations. The market specializes in cold-weather gear, preserved foods, and crafts made from materials only found in glacier environments. A special section called the "Poké Exchange" allows Pokémon to trade items they've found or created without human intervention. The most coveted goods are "Articuno Feathers," rare items said to fall from the legendary bird during its periodic flights over the glacier.

- **Warrior's Hall** (Krigerhal): A massive longhouse serving as both training facility and community gathering space. The hall features a central arena where humans and Pokémon train together in combat techniques, with specialized areas for different Pokémon types. The walls are decorated with shields bearing the crests of prominent families and their partner Pokémon, along with trophies from regional battle tournaments. The hall is overseen by Battle Jarl Sigrid Stormaxe and her partner Beartic, who have defended the town against wild Pokémon attacks for over twenty years.

- **Runestone Library** (Runebibliotek): A knowledge repository carved directly into the glacier ice, maintained at precise temperatures by a team of Cryogonal. The library contains stone and ice tablets rather than books, with ancient knowledge carved using techniques that combine human runic traditions with patterns inspired by Unown. The most precious artifacts are the "Saga Stones," a series of tablets depicting the first encounters between humans and legendary Ice-type Pokémon like Articuno and Kyurem. The library is tended by Rune Jarl Eirik Frostwhisper and his partner Gothitelle, who can psychically translate the oldest runes.

- **Hot Spring Caverns** (Varmekildehulene): An extensive network of underground caves centered around natural hot springs, serving as both social gathering places and vital heat sources during the harshest weather. Different caverns are maintained at various temperatures through partnerships with Pokémon like Camerupt (for heating) and Aurorus (for cooling). The central pool, known as "Kyurem's Tear" (Kyurems Tåre), is said to have healing properties for both humans and Pokémon, particularly effective for treating frostbite and cold-related ailments.

## Notable Establishments

- **Valhalla Inn** (Valhallherberge): A traditional Norse-inspired lodging built around a massive central hearth where travelers can rent sleeping platforms in the communal great room or private chambers for higher fees. The inn's most distinctive feature is its "Pokémon Mead Hall," a specially designed space where travelers' Pokémon can socialize with local Pokémon while their trainers rest. The inn is run by a former Battle Jarl named Leif Snowbeard and his partner Mamoswine, who entertain guests with tales of their adventures across the glacier.

- **Frost Forge** (Frostsmie): A smithy specializing in cold-resistant metals and tools designed for glacier survival. The forge is unique for its "cold-forging" techniques developed through partnerships between Fire-type Pokémon like Heatmor and Ice-types like Glalie, who work together to create metals with unique properties. Their masterwork items are "Frost Blades," specially treated weapons that can channel Ice-type energy when wielded by a trainer with a strong bond to an Ice-type Pokémon.

- **Yuki-onna's Whisper** (Yukionnashvisken): A mysterious shop that appears to sell ordinary cold-weather clothing but is rumored to be run by a woman who is part Yokai. The proprietress, known only as "The Winter Lady," creates garments that seem to adapt to changing weather conditions and occasionally predict blizzards by changing color. Her constant companion is a Froslass that local children believe is actually the shopkeeper's true form.

## Cultural Practices

Frosthold is known for its "Battle Bond" tradition, where trainers and their Pokémon develop fighting techniques that involve both acting in tandem. Unlike regions where Pokémon battle while trainers command from the sidelines, Frosthold trainers physically participate alongside their partners, using weapons and movements that complement their Pokémon's abilities. The most accomplished practitioners can reportedly achieve a state called "Frost Unity" (Frostenhet), where trainer and Pokémon move with perfect synchronization.

The town observes a unique daily rhythm called "Hearth and Hunt" (Arne og Jakt), alternating periods of intense outdoor activity with communal rest around fire sources. This practice, developed through centuries of adapting to the harsh environment, creates a natural cycle of exertion and recovery that visitors find both exhausting and exhilarating.

Visitors are welcomed with the "Frost Test" (Frostprøven) ceremony, where they must demonstrate some form of resilience or skill before being fully accepted into the community. This might involve withstanding the cold, showing battle prowess, or demonstrating a useful craft. Those who impress the locals may be gifted with a "Frost Token" (Frostmerke), a small carving made from Never-Melting Ice that grants the bearer recognition as a friend of Frosthold in all Skeljord settlements.
