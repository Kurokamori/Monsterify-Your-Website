# Greenleaf (Lùyè Zhèn 綠葉鎮)

This charming town serves as a harmonious community hub where humans and Grass-type Pokémon live in perfect symbiosis. Built around and within a cluster of ancient trees, Greenleaf represents the Wood element in Shaolong Forest's Wu Xing philosophy. With its distinctive Chinese garden-inspired design and living architecture, it provides both a nurturing home for residents and a fascinating glimpse into Pokémon-human integration for travelers.

## History

Founded over 500 years ago by a legendary Pokémon trainer known as the "Leaf Whisperer" who could communicate with Celebi, the town began as a simple meditation retreat. According to local legend, the founder's partner Pokémon—a wise Venusaur—taught the first settlers how to grow buildings rather than construct them. The massive central tree, known as the "First Leaf," is said to have been planted by Celebi itself, bringing seeds from a future where humans and Pokémon had achieved perfect harmony.

## Town Features

- **Harmony Circle** (Héxí Guàng Chǎng): The heart of community activity featuring a circular plaza built around the massive "First Leaf" tree. The plaza's stone patterns form the ancient Taijitu (yin-yang symbol), with the black and white sections planted with contrasting flowers tended by Sunflora during day and Shiinotic at night. The tree itself hosts dozens of Grass and Bug-type Pokémon who are considered the town's oldest citizens. Community gatherings, Tai Chi practice, and Type Meditation sessions occur here daily.

- **Leaf Market** (Yè Shìchǎng): A bustling open-air market where humans and their Pokémon partners sell goods grown or crafted together. Grass-type Pokémon like Leafeon and Roserade help tend stalls selling medicinal herbs, while Bug-types like Leavanny demonstrate silk weaving. The market features a special section called the "Poké Exchange" where Pokémon themselves trade items they've found or created, using a barter system overseen by a wise Oranguru. The most coveted items are "Celebi Sprouts," rare plants said to have temporal properties.

- **Five Element School** (Wǔxíng Xuéxiào): An educational complex where young trainers learn alongside their Pokémon partners. The school is divided into five pavilions, each dedicated to one of the Wu Xing elements and specializing in different types of Pokémon. Students rotate through all five elements to achieve balance in their training. The Wood pavilion, being in Greenleaf, is the largest and specializes in Grass-type training. The school's headmaster is a venerable Sceptile who has been teaching for over 80 years and communicates through a psychic translator Pokémon.

- **Living Quarters** (Hó Yè Jū): Residential areas where homes are partially grown rather than fully built. Families partner with Pokémon like Torterra and Trevenant to create living structures that evolve over generations. Houses are arranged according to Feng Shui principles, with positions determined by the types of Pokémon residing there to create harmonious energy flow. Many homes feature "Poké rooms" specifically designed for the family's partner Pokémon, with elements that cater to their type needs—such as small pools for Water-types or sunny meditation platforms for Grass-types.

- **Bamboo Gardens** (Zhú Yùan): A serene bamboo forest at the edge of town where special varieties of bamboo are cultivated by Passimian and Pangoro. The gardens feature meditation pavilions where visitors can practice "Green Meditation" alongside Psychic/Grass dual-type Pokémon like Exeggutor. At the center stands the "Whisper Grove," where the bamboo grows in such a way that it creates natural music when the wind blows, enhanced by the occasional songs of Kricketune who make their homes there.

## Notable Establishments

- **Leaf and Lotus Inn** (Yè Hé Lún Guǎn): A traditional Chinese-style inn where each room is partially formed by a different species of Grass-type Pokémon. The most prestigious suite is the "Celebi Room," where the walls are formed by a Torterra so ancient that small temporal distortions occasionally occur, giving guests glimpses of the room's past or future. The inn's garden features a pond where Lotad and Lombre provide relaxing water features.

- **Five Harmony Restaurant** (Wǔ Hé Cānguǎn): A specialty restaurant serving dishes that balance the five elemental flavors according to Wu Xing philosophy. The signature dish is "Celebi's Blessing," a color-changing soup containing ingredients from different seasons, prepared with the help of Grass and Psychic-type Pokémon. The restaurant features a unique dining experience where compatible Pokémon are invited to join their trainers at specially designed tables.

- **Silk Weaver's Guild** (Sī Chóu Huì): A traditional crafts center where humans work alongside Bug-type Pokémon like Leavanny and Ariados to create exquisite silk items. Visitors can watch master weavers and their Pokémon partners create intricate tapestries depicting legendary events from Shaolong Forest's history. The guild's masterpiece is the "Celebi Tapestry," which seems to show slightly different scenes depending on when you look at it.

## Cultural Practices

Greenleaf is known for its "Grass Whisper" tradition, where residents learn to communicate with Grass-type Pokémon through a combination of subtle movements, energy sensing, and meditation. The most skilled practitioners can reportedly understand complex concepts from their Pokémon partners and even communicate with wild Pokémon.

The town observes a unique daily rhythm called "Sun Following," where activities shift with the movement of sunlight through the forest canopy. This practice, developed through centuries of living with photosynthetic Pokémon partners, creates a natural flow to the day that visitors find both disorienting and refreshing.

Visitors are welcomed with the "Leaf Blessing" ceremony, where they receive a small seedling grown by Bulbasaur that is said to bring good fortune if planted at home. Many travelers report that these seedlings grow with unusual speed and vitality, sometimes attracting wild Grass-type Pokémon to their gardens.
