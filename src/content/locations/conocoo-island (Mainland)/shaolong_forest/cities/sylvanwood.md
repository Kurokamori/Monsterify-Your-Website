# Sylvanwood (Sèn Lín Chéng 森林城)

This magnificent forest metropolis serves as the capital of Shaolong Forest, blending traditional Chinese imperial architecture with living Pokémon-integrated structures. With its substantial population of 60,000 humans and approximately 45,000 Pokémon citizens, Sylvanwood represents the pinnacle of harmonious coexistence between civilization and nature, where buildings grow alongside trees and city planning follows both Feng Shui principles and natural Pokémon migration patterns.

## History

Sylvanwood was founded 1,000 years ago when the legendary Dragon Tamer Emperor Shaolong established his court at the convergence of five ley lines representing the Wu Xing elements. According to ancient scrolls, the Emperor's partner Pokémon—a golden Rayquaza—created the initial clearing by flying in a perfect circle, its energy causing the trees to bend outward rather than fall, forming a natural wall around what would become the Imperial District.

Over centuries, the city expanded outward in five directions, each representing one of the Wu Xing elements, with architecture and Pokémon populations reflecting these elemental associations. The city experienced a golden age 500 years ago when Celebi allegedly blessed the region, causing an unprecedented harmonization between humans and Pokémon that led to the development of living architecture techniques still used today.
