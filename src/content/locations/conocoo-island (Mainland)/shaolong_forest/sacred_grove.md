# Sacred Grove (Shèng Lín 聖林)

This mystical heart of Shaolong Forest serves as a spiritual nexus where the boundaries between the human world, the Pokémon world, and the realm of nature spirits grow thin. The ancient grove, with its massive trees that predate human settlement, is considered the most sacred site in the region—a place where Celebi is said to appear during moments of perfect natural harmony, and where young trainers receive their first partner Pokémon through the "Ceremony of Matching Spirits."

## History

According to ancient scrolls kept by the Council of Five Elements, the Sacred Grove was created when five legendary Pokémon representing the Wu Xing elements gathered at this spot over 2,000 years ago:

- Rayquaza (Wood) brought seeds from distant lands
- Ho-Oh (Fire) blessed the soil with life-giving warmth
- Groudon (Earth) enriched the ground with nutrients
- Dialga (Metal) infused the area with temporal energy
- Kyogre (Water) provided pure rain to nourish growth

Their combined power created a sanctuary where time flows differently than in the surrounding forest, allowing plants to grow to extraordinary sizes and ages. The first human settlers discovered the grove when following a group of Celebi that appeared during a solar eclipse. Recognizing its spiritual significance, they established the tradition of seeking harmony with Pokémon that continues to this day.

## Features

- **The Ancient Circle** (Gǔ Yùan): A ring of sixteen massive trees, each over 200 feet tall and wider than ten people with arms outstretched. These trees are believed to be sentient, with some scholars suggesting they may be extremely ancient Trevenant who have chosen to remain in tree form for centuries. The trees form a perfect circle around a clearing where the "Ceremony of Matching Spirits" takes place. Each tree represents a different Pokémon type, and their massive roots form natural alcoves where meditation is said to be particularly effective.

- **Celebi's Shrine** (Sì Bì Gōng): A small, elegant structure at the center of the Ancient Circle, built not by human hands but by Pokémon working together. The shrine is constructed from living wood shaped by Grass-types, stones positioned by Fighting-types, and crystal elements contributed by Psychic-types. The shrine contains no human-made objects, only natural offerings like berries and flowers. A small pool at its center is said to occasionally show reflections of other time periods when Celebi is near.

- **Time Pools** (Shíjiān Chí): Seven small ponds scattered throughout the grove that exhibit strange temporal properties. Plants growing near these pools may bloom out of season, and visitors report experiencing time at different rates near different pools—minutes passing like hours at some, and hours feeling like moments at others. Pokémon researchers believe these pools are connected to Celebi's time-travel abilities. Water from these pools is used in important ceremonies and is said to have healing properties for both humans and Pokémon.

- **Harmony Stones** (Hé Xì Shí): A circle of standing stones surrounding the Ancient Circle, each carved with symbols representing the relationship between humans and specific Pokémon types. These stones are believed to have been placed by the first human settlers under the guidance of Psychic-type Pokémon. During solstices and equinoxes, the stones align with celestial bodies to create patterns of light that illuminate different parts of the grove. Young trainers touch these stones during the Ceremony of Matching Spirits to help determine their compatible Pokémon type.

- **Whisper Bamboo** (Xī Suǒ Zhú): A dense stand of unusual bamboo that grows only in this grove. The hollow stalks are naturally positioned to catch the wind in ways that create sounds resembling Pokémon cries or human whispers. Visitors often report hearing messages that seem personally significant to them. The bamboo is tended by a family of Passimian who have developed a complex sign language to communicate with human caretakers without disturbing the grove's tranquility.

## The Ceremony of Matching Spirits

The most significant event held in the Sacred Grove is the "Ceremony of Matching Spirits" (Hún Yùn Yí Shè), where children who have reached the age of ten are brought to receive their first partner Pokémon. Unlike regions where children choose or are assigned starter Pokémon, in Shaolong Forest the Pokémon and child find each other through a spiritual connection.

The ceremony takes place during the new moon, when the grove is illuminated only by bioluminescent Pokémon like Morelull and Shiinotic. Children sit in meditation at the center of the Ancient Circle for a full night, while potential partner Pokémon gather in the surrounding forest. According to tradition, Celebi subtly influences which Pokémon approaches each child, matching them based on complementary spirits rather than similar personalities.

By dawn, most children have been approached by the Pokémon that will become their lifelong partner. Those who haven't formed a connection return for up to three consecutive new moons. If no connection forms after three ceremonies, the child is believed to have a different destiny and may be guided toward specialized roles like grove caretaker or Council scribe.

## Guardian Pokémon

The Sacred Grove is protected by several powerful Pokémon who are considered its guardians rather than residents:

- A venerable Sceptile who has lived for over 150 years serves as the primary guardian, coordinating the other protectors and communicating with the Council of Five Elements
- A trio of Decidueye patrol the airspace above the grove, ensuring no unauthorized Flying-types enter the sacred space
- A wise Alakazam maintains psychic barriers that prevent those with harmful intentions from finding the grove's true center
- A gentle Suicune visits periodically to purify the Time Pools and is said to be a messenger between Celebi and the legendary beasts

These guardians rarely interact with visitors but are sometimes visible during important ceremonies or when the grove is threatened.

## Visitor Experience

Access to the Sacred Grove is strictly limited and controlled by the Council of Five Elements. Casual tourists are not permitted beyond the outer boundaries, marked by red torii gates with Unown inscriptions warning against disrespectful behavior. Serious pilgrims and researchers may apply for limited access by demonstrating their understanding of the grove's significance and agreeing to strict behavioral protocols.

Those granted entry must be accompanied by a member of the "Grove Harmony Guild," humans who have dedicated their lives to maintaining the grove's balance and who have formed special bonds with the guardian Pokémon. Visitors must observe silence except at designated speaking stones, may not collect any material from the grove, and must make a small offering (typically berries or clear water) at Celebi's Shrine.

Many visitors report unusual experiences during their time in the grove, such as:
- Glimpses of Pokémon that shouldn't exist in the region
- Temporary ability to understand their partner Pokémon's thoughts
- Dreams featuring events from their past or possible futures
- Seeing their own reflection in the Time Pools as a younger or older version of themselves

The most fortunate visitors might witness the grove's ultimate phenomenon—a "Time Bloom" (Shíjiān Huākāi), when all plants in the grove briefly flower simultaneously regardless of their natural season, signaling Celebi's unseen presence. This event is considered a blessing that brings good fortune for the coming year.
