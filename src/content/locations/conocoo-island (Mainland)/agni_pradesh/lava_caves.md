# Lava Caves

The Lava Caves of Agni Pradesh form an extensive network of tunnels and chambers created by ancient volcanic activity. These natural wonders feature smooth, glassy walls in vibrant reds, oranges, and blacks, with some passages still warm to the touch from magma flowing deep below.

## Cave System Features

- **Glowing Pools**: Chambers with pools of water that glow due to heat-reactive minerals
- **Crystal Galleries**: Sections where heat and pressure have created stunning crystal formations
- **Breath Vents**: Natural chimneys where hot air from the volcano's depths creates constant warm breezes
- **Echo Chambers**: Perfectly formed acoustic spaces where sounds resonate in unusual ways
- **Living Caves**: Areas where specialized heat-loving fungi and bacteria create bioluminescent displays

The caves are partially developed for tourism, with reinforced pathways and lighting in the safer sections. Guided tours range from easy one-hour walks suitable for families to challenging full-day expeditions for experienced spelunkers. The deeper sections remain unexplored and are off-limits without special permits from the Agni Pradesh Geological Authority.

Local healers collect minerals and specialized fungi from the caves for traditional remedies, particularly those used to treat respiratory ailments and joint inflammation.
