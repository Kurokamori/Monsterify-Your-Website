# Fire Temple

The Fire Temple stands as the spiritual heart of Agni Pradesh, a massive domed structure built from heat-resistant red stone and volcanic glass. At its center burns the Eternal Flame, said to have been ignited by the first settlers of the region and kept burning continuously for centuries.

## Features

- **The Eternal Flame**: A massive central hearth that has burned without interruption for generations
- **Fire Keepers' Quarters**: Housing for the dedicated priests who tend the flame day and night
- **Meditation Chambers**: Heat-resistant rooms where devotees can meditate in proximity to intense heat
- **Flame Gardens**: Outdoor areas where controlled fire pits create beautiful patterns of light
- **Ceremonial Forge**: Where special ceremonial items are crafted during important festivals

Visitors are welcome to observe most rituals, though they must remove footwear and speak in hushed tones. The temple is busiest during the Festival of Renewal, when pilgrims from across Conocoo Island come to light torches from the Eternal Flame to bring its blessing back to their homes.
