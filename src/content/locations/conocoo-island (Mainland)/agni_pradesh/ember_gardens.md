# Ember Gardens

The Ember Gardens are a unique botanical attraction where heat-loving plants thrive in the volcanic soil of Agni Pradesh. These carefully cultivated gardens showcase flora that not only survive but flourish in extreme heat, with some species that actually require fire to germinate.

## Garden Features

- **Ash Beds**: Gardens of specialized plants that grow directly in volcanic ash
- **Thermal Pools**: Hot springs surrounded by heat-resistant ferns and mosses
- **Fire Bloom Section**: Area featuring plants that only flower when exposed to extreme heat
- **Phoenix Trees**: Rare trees with bark that chars but doesn't burn, protecting the living tissue beneath
- **Seed Activation Station**: Educational area where visitors can watch fire-activated seeds germinate

The gardens are maintained by botanists who have developed specialized techniques for cultivating these unusual plants. Guided tours are available daily, with special night tours offered during the full moon when some of the plants emit a subtle glow in response to the moonlight reflecting off the heated ground.
