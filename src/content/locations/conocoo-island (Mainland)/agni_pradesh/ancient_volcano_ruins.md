# Ancient Volcano Ruins

Deep within the volcanic highlands of Agni Pradesh lie the mysterious Ancient Volcano Ruins, remnants of a civilization that thrived here long before the current settlements. These structures, partially preserved by layers of cooled lava, offer tantalizing glimpses into an advanced culture that harnessed volcanic power in ways modern inhabitants are still trying to understand.

## Notable Features

- **The Obsidian Temple**: A perfectly preserved shrine made entirely of volcanic glass
- **Lava Channels**: Engineered pathways that once directed molten lava for unknown purposes
- **Heat Runes**: Mysterious symbols carved into stone that still emanate warmth when touched
- **Forge Chambers**: Ancient metalworking facilities with technologies lost to time
- **Crystal Caverns**: Chambers where heat and pressure created unique mineral formations

Archaeologists from the Flame Academy maintain a permanent research station at the ruins, carefully documenting and studying each discovery. Visitors must obtain permits and be accompanied by authorized guides, as some areas remain unstable and others contain artifacts too valuable to risk damage. Local legends claim that on the summer solstice, certain chambers align with the sun in ways that reveal hidden passages deeper into the volcano.
