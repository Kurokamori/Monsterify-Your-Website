# Xocoatl Baiyu (Chocolate Valley)

The inhabitants of Xocoatl Baiyu have developed a rich culture shaped by their symbiotic relationship with Grass, Bug, and Fairy-type Pokémon, as well as their deep reverence for the sacred art of flavor creation. Their society blends elements of Aztec, Mayan, and other Mesoamerican traditions with unique practices born from centuries of Pokémon partnership, creating a civilization that values culinary excellence, agricultural harmony, and the spiritual significance of taste as a connection between humans, Pokémon, and the divine.

## Culture and Society

### Social Structure and Governance

Xocoatl Baiyu is governed by the Council of Five Flavors (Macuiltonalli in the local dialect), a ruling body that combines culinary mastery with spiritual leadership. The council consists of:

- **Sweet Sovereign** (Tlatoani Tzopelic): The leader who has mastered sweet flavors and works primarily with Fairy-type Pokémon like Alcremie and Slurpuff

- **Bitter Guardian** (Tlatoani Chichic): The council member responsible for bitter flavors, working closely with certain Grass-type Pokémon like Roserade and Tsareena

- **Sour Keeper** (Tlatoani Xococ): The master of sour flavors who partners with Bug-type Pokémon like Butterfree and Ribombee that help cultivate fermentation

- **Salty Protector** (Tlatoani Poyec): The council member who oversees salty flavors and works with Ground and Rock-type Pokémon to maintain mineral harvesting

- **Umami Sage** (Tlatoani Ahuiac): The master of savory flavors who partners with Psychic-type Pokémon like Musharna and Indeedee to enhance flavor perception

This council makes decisions based on both practical needs and flavor harmony principles, with the goal of maintaining balance between humans, Pokémon, and the agricultural ecosystem. When conflicts arise, they are resolved through a tasting ceremony called "Flavor Judgment" (Tlacualli Tlatzontequia), where all parties prepare dishes that represent their perspective, and the council evaluates not just taste but the harmony and intention behind each creation.

Society is organized into specialized guilds called Calpulli (houses), each dedicated to different aspects of flavor creation and food production:

- **Cacao Calpulli**: Specialists in chocolate cultivation and preparation who work primarily with Grass and Bug-type Pokémon
- **Nectar Calpulli**: Experts in sweet flavors and honey production who partner with Fairy and Bug-types like Ribombee and Vespiquen
- **Spice Calpulli**: Masters of heat and complex flavors who work with Fire and Grass-type Pokémon
- **Fermentation Calpulli**: Practitioners who specialize in transformed foods, working with Poison and Bug-types
- **Essence Calpulli**: Extractors of pure flavors who partner with Psychic and Fairy-types to capture subtle taste elements

Each guild maintains its own traditions, secret techniques, and specialized Pokémon partnerships, with knowledge passed down through apprenticeship systems that include both human and Pokémon mentors.

### Daily Life and Customs

Residents begin each day with "Flavor Greeting" (Tlacualli Tlapalhuia), a ritual where they and their Pokémon partners taste a small amount of each of the five basic flavors to awaken the palate and honor the balance of taste. Many families maintain "flavor altars" in their homes where small offerings of particularly successful dishes are presented to legendary Pokémon like Shaymin and Celebi, believed to influence agricultural abundance.

Homes typically feature a "tasting space" (Tlacualoyan) where family members and their Pokémon partners gather to share meals and evaluate new flavor creations. These spaces usually contain a small stone mortar and pestle (molcajete) passed down through generations, believed to absorb and enhance flavors over time, and a collection of specially grown berries that represent the family's flavor lineage.

Children receive their first partner Pokémon through the "Flavor Affinity Ceremony" (Tlacualli Hueliliztli) when they turn ten years old. Rather than choosing their Pokémon, they participate in a ritual where they prepare a dish that represents their personality, and the Pokémon that responds most strongly to their creation is considered their destined partner. This bond is formalized through a ceremony where both child and Pokémon share a meal prepared from ingredients they've gathered together.

### Cuisine

Xocoatl Baiyu cuisine is world-renowned for its complexity and depth, built around the sacred cacao bean and an intricate understanding of how different flavors interact. The cooking style emphasizes the five fundamental tastes in careful balance, with each dish designed to tell a story or evoke specific emotions. Signature creations include:

- **Sacred Xocoatl** (Teoatl): A complex chocolate drink made from specially grown cacao beans tended by Tropius and Abomasnow, infused with spices and honey collected by Ribombee. Unlike modern hot chocolate, this traditional beverage is often spicy and bitter, served in ceremonial contexts to connect with divine energies. Different variations are prepared for different Pokémon types, with ingredients adjusted to enhance their natural abilities.

- **Flavor Tamales** (Tlacualli Tamalli): Corn dough parcels with twenty-one different fillings representing the twenty-one sacred berries, steamed in leaves harvested from Grass-type Pokémon like Lurantis and Leafeon. These tamales are not just food but also teaching tools, with each filling designed to highlight a specific flavor principle. The most complex versions contain all five basic tastes in perfect harmony.

- **Berry Mole** (Xocotl Molli): Rich, complex sauces made from dozens of ingredients, each prepared with the assistance of different Pokémon. Fire-types like Centiskorch control the toasting of spices, Water-types like Inteleon provide precisely pressurized water for extractions, and Psychic-types like Indeedee help monitor the subtle changes in aroma during the hours-long cooking process. The most prestigious moles contain over 100 ingredients and take days to prepare.

- **Living Salads** (Yolcatlacualli): Fresh dishes made from ingredients so recently harvested they're considered still "alive" with energy. These salads are prepared at the table with the assistance of Grass-type Pokémon who help maintain the plants' vitality until the moment of consumption. The practice is believed to transfer the life energy directly to the consumer.

Many meals are prepared as spiritual practices, with specific rituals for harvesting, preparing, and consuming food. The most sacred dining tradition is the "Five Realms Meal" (Macuilchan Tlacualli), where five courses representing different domains (earth, water, air, fire, and spirit) are prepared and shared by humans and their Pokémon partners, creating a complete cosmological experience through taste.

### Festivals and Celebrations

- **Cacao Harvest Festival** (Xocoatl Pixquilitl): An annual celebration marking the main cacao harvest. The festival begins with a procession where Grass and Bug-type Pokémon lead humans to the cacao groves, followed by a careful harvesting ceremony where prayers are offered to Shaymin and Celebi. The highlight is the "First Grinding," where the Sweet Sovereign and their Alcremie partner process the first beans of the season into a sacred drink shared among community leaders. The festival concludes with a massive feast featuring hundreds of chocolate variations.

- **Flavor Alignment Ceremony** (Tlacualli Nehnemilistli): A solstice celebration where culinary creations are aligned with celestial movements. Dishes are prepared on specific schedules coordinated with the sun and moon's positions, with Psychic-type Pokémon like Beheeyem and Gothitelle helping to time each preparation step perfectly. The ceremony culminates at noon when sunlight passes through specially positioned honey-glass windows to illuminate the central feast table, believed to infuse the food with cosmic energy.

- **Berry Communion** (Xocotl Tlamanalli): A spring festival celebrating the berry harvest, where humans and Pokémon participate in a massive berry-tasting event. Twenty-one different berry varieties are presented in their pure form, then in progressively more complex combinations. Bug-type Pokémon like Ribombee perform elaborate dances that tell the story of pollination and growth, while Grass-types demonstrate the life cycle of berry plants. The festival concludes with the planting of next year's berry crops in a ceremony led by the Bitter Guardian.

- **Digital Flavor Convergence** (Tlacualli Tlatzonhuiliztli): A modern festival coinciding with specific astronomical alignments when the barrier between the physical world and the Digital World's Gourmet Zone grows thin. Digimon like Digitamamon and BanchoLeomon are said to sometimes share recipes during this time, and locals prepare special digital-inspired dishes at terminals maintained by Porygon-Z.

- **Yokai Feast Night** (Yohualli Tlacualli): A solemn observance held during the dark moon, when food spirits are believed to be most active. Residents prepare special dishes for food Yokai like Hitotsume-kozo and Mikoshi-nyudo, leaving them at crossroads and kitchen thresholds. Ghost-type Pokémon like Polteageist and Sinistea participate in these ceremonies, acting as intermediaries between humans and the Yokai realm. It's believed that appeasing these spirits ensures culinary success for the coming month.

### Crafts and Arts

- **Flavor Tapestry** (Tlacualli Tilmatli): Textile art using natural dyes derived from food ingredients, often with patterns that represent flavor combinations and culinary techniques. These tapestries are created with the assistance of Bug-type Pokémon like Leavanny who help process plant fibers, and Fairy-types like Sylveon who can sense color harmonies.

- **Aroma Sculpture** (Ahuiyac Toltecatl): Three-dimensional artworks designed to release specific scent combinations when touched or warmed. Created through partnerships between human artisans and Pokémon like Indeedee and Slurpuff who have heightened scent perception.

- **Taste Music** (Tlacualli Cuicatl): Musical traditions where compositions are designed to complement and enhance specific flavor experiences. Performances often include Pokémon musicians like Kricketune and Rillaboom, with melodies that supposedly prepare the palate for particular taste sensations.

- **Flavor Codices** (Tlacualli Amoxtli): Illustrated manuscripts similar to Aztec codices but dedicated to recording culinary knowledge. These books use a specialized pictographic writing system to document recipes, ingredient properties, and flavor principles. The most valuable codices are maintained by Psychic-type Pokémon who can preserve the knowledge even if the physical book is damaged.

- **Living Gastronomy** (Yolcatlacualli Toltecayotl): The art of creating edible sculptures and presentations that remain "alive" until consumption, often incorporating still-growing plants and the abilities of Grass-type Pokémon to maintain freshness and vitality.

### Spiritual Beliefs and Practices

The people of Xocoatl Baiyu practice a spiritual tradition that blends elements of Mesoamerican polytheism with reverence for Pokémon as divine messengers and embodiments of natural forces. They believe that flavors are direct connections to different aspects of the cosmos, and that through culinary mastery, humans can communicate with higher realms.

Their cosmology includes both legendary Pokémon and flavor deities:

- Shaymin is revered as the Gratitude Provider who ensures agricultural abundance
- Celebi is honored as the Season Keeper who maintains the cycles of growth and harvest
- Mew is respected as the Original Flavor, containing the essence of all taste possibilities
- Xochipilli (Flower Prince) is viewed as a flavor deity associated with Grass-type Pokémon
- Tlaloc (Rain Deity) is connected with Water-types and the purity of ingredients

Many residents practice "Flavor Meditation" (Tlacualli Neyolnonotzaliztli), where they focus intensely on a single taste, gradually expanding their awareness to understand its complete nature and connections. Advanced practitioners can reportedly achieve a state called "Complete Taste" (Centetl Tlacualli), where they briefly perceive the entire network of flavors that exist in the world, gaining insights into new culinary possibilities.

The most dedicated spiritual practitioners undertake the "Twenty-One Berry Pilgrimage" (Cempoalxochitl Ohtli), visiting twenty-one sacred sites associated with different berry types and performing taste rituals at each location. Those who complete this journey are said to receive a blessing from Mew, manifesting as an enhanced ability to perceive subtle flavors and create harmonious combinations.

### Training and Education

Education in Xocoatl Baiyu follows a holistic approach that integrates academic knowledge, culinary training, and Pokémon partnership. Children begin their formal education at age six in "Flavor Schools" (Tlacualli Calmecac), where they learn alongside young Pokémon in mixed-species classrooms.

The curriculum includes:

- **Flavor Writing** (Tlacuilli): Literacy taught through the region's specialized pictographic system that represents tastes and ingredients
- **Culinary History** (Tlacualli Tlahtollotl): Study of the region's past through both human records and traditional recipes
- **Taste Mathematics** (Tlapohualli): Mathematical principles taught through practical applications like measuring ingredients and calculating fermentation times
- **Pokémon Harmony** (Pokétl Yolmelahuac): Techniques for working effectively with different Pokémon types in food production
- **Flavor Craft** (Tlacualli Toltecayotl): Hands-on training in basic cooking techniques and ingredient preparation

At age ten, children undergo the Flavor Affinity Ceremony and begin specialized training based on their Pokémon partner and personal inclinations. Many continue their education at one of the culinary guilds, where they may spend years developing both their technical skills and their understanding of flavor principles.

The most prestigious educational institution is the Grand Culinary Academy (Huey Tlacualli Calmecac) in Flavortown, where the most promising students train under the direct guidance of the Council of Five Flavors and their Pokémon partners. Graduation from the academy requires the creation of an original "Masterwork Dish" that demonstrates perfect harmony of all five fundamental flavors.

The people of Xocoatl Baiyu welcome visitors who show respect for local food traditions and the sacred relationship between flavors, humans, and Pokémon. Tourists are encouraged to participate in the "Visitor's Taste" ceremony, where they're introduced to the five fundamental flavors and taught basic etiquette for participating in the region's culinary culture.
