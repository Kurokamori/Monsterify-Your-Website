# Vanilla Fields (Vainilla Milli)

This aromatic settlement serves as the center of vanilla cultivation in Xocoatl Baiyu, offering visitors an immersive experience in the sacred art of flavor cultivation. With its distinctive Mesoamerican-inspired architecture integrated with Grass and Bug-type Pokémon habitats, Vanilla Fields provides both a spiritual connection to the region's culinary traditions and a sensory journey through carefully designed aromatic landscapes.

## History

Founded over 400 years ago by the legendary flavor master Xochitl and her partner Vileplume, Vanilla Fields began as a small agricultural outpost dedicated to cultivating the precious vanilla orchid. According to local legend, Xochitl discovered a unique symbiotic relationship between vanilla plants and certain Grass-type Pokémon, particularly Tropius and Lurantis, whose natural abilities enhanced the orchids' flavor development.

The settlement gained prominence 250 years ago when a visiting Shaymin allegedly blessed the fields, creating a microclimate perfect for vanilla cultivation. This event is commemorated in the annual "Gratitude Pollination" festival and has made the town famous for producing vanilla beans with unparalleled complexity and depth of flavor.

## Town Features

- **Flavor Plaza** (Tlacualli Tianquiztli): The heart of community activity, featuring a circular stone platform with intricate carvings representing the twenty-one sacred berries of Xocoatl tradition. The plaza is surrounded by vanilla-bearing vines tended by Grass-type Pokémon like Leafeon and Tsareena, creating a naturally fragrant gathering space. At the center stands the "Eternal Vanilla" (Cemicac Vainilla), a massive vanilla orchid said to be descended from the original plant discovered by Xochitl, now tended by her descendant's Vileplume. The plaza hosts daily "Aroma Meditations" at dawn and dusk, where residents and their Pokémon partners practice mindfulness through scent appreciation.

- **Pollination Market** (Xochiyotl Tianquiztli): An open-air market where specialized vanilla products and pollination services are traded. The market is organized around a partnership between human vendors and Bug-type Pokémon like Ribombee and Butterfree who offer precise pollination for different plant varieties. Unique to this market is the "Flavor Exchange" where cultivators trade vanilla beans with specific aromatic profiles, each certified by Pokémon with enhanced olfactory abilities like Indeedee and Slurpuff. The most valuable items are "Shaymin-Blessed Beans," vanilla pods that have been exposed to the legendary Pokémon's gratitude energy, producing flavors said to evoke profound emotional responses.

- **Curing House** (Pahtli Calli): A massive stepped structure reminiscent of Mesoamerican temples but designed specifically for the vanilla curing process. The building features different microclimates on each level, maintained by partnerships between Fire-type Pokémon like Centiskorch who provide precise heat, and Water-types like Inteleon who control humidity. The curing process is overseen by the Vanilla Sages (Vainilla Tlamatinime), experts who work with Psychic-type Pokémon to monitor the subtle chemical changes during fermentation. The building's design allows for natural air circulation patterns that enhance the development of over 250 distinct flavor compounds in the beans.

- **Orchid Dwellings** (Xochitl Chantli): Residential areas built in harmony with vanilla orchid cultivation, where homes are partially constructed around living vanilla vines. The architecture follows traditional Mesoamerican designs with low, stone buildings featuring honey-glass windows that filter sunlight to create optimal growing conditions. Many houses incorporate special "Pokémon platforms" where Grass and Bug-type partners can rest while maintaining constant connection with the plants. The most prestigious homes belong to master pollinators, with exteriors decorated in patterns that mimic the markings of Ribombee and Butterfree wings, believed to attract beneficial Pokémon to the area.

- **Aroma Gardens** (Ahuiyac Xochimilli): Elaborate gardens designed to create complementary scent combinations that enhance vanilla's complex flavor profile. These gardens are arranged in mandala patterns based on Mesoamerican calendar systems, with different plants blooming in sequence throughout the year to create an ever-changing aromatic landscape. The gardens are maintained through partnerships between human gardeners and Pokémon like Roserade and Lurantis who help manage the delicate balance of scents. At the center of each garden stands a "Scent Stone" (Ahuiyac Tetl), a porous rock infused with essential oils that gradually releases fragrance when warmed by the sun.

## Notable Establishments

- **Vanilla Dream Inn** (Vainilla Temictli Calli): A traditional lodging built around a central courtyard filled with flowering vanilla orchids. Each room features a different aromatic theme, with scent profiles designed to induce specific types of dreams. The inn is managed by Madam Copalxochitl and her partner Musharna, who use the Pokémon's dream mist abilities to enhance guests' nocturnal experiences. The most sought-after accommodation is the "Shaymin Suite," where the bed is surrounded by specially cultivated flowers said to promote dreams of gratitude and abundance.

- **Five Flavor Café** (Macuilli Tlacualli Café): A culinary establishment specializing in dishes that showcase vanilla in all five fundamental taste categories (sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami). The café features open kitchens where visitors can observe the collaboration between human chefs and their Pokémon partners, particularly Alcremie and Slurpuff who have natural abilities to enhance and balance flavors. The signature offering is the "Tasting Journey" (Tlacualli Ohtli), a progression of twenty-one small dishes that demonstrate vanilla's remarkable versatility beyond sweet applications.

- **Essence Workshop** (Ahuiyac Tequitiliztli): A collaborative space where humans work alongside Pokémon to extract and preserve vanilla's complex flavors. The workshop produces everything from culinary extracts to aromatic oils used in spiritual practices. Visitors can participate in guided extraction sessions where they learn traditional techniques under the tutelage of skilled essence masters and their Pokémon partners, particularly Indeedee who can sense when extractions have reached optimal potency. The workshop's most precious creation is "Vanilla Soul" (Vainilla Teyolia), a rare extract produced only during specific lunar phases with the assistance of Fairy-type Pokémon.

- **Xochipilli Shrine** (Xochipilli Teocalli): A small temple dedicated to the Flower Prince deity and his Pokémon manifestations, particularly Shaymin and Celebi. The shrine is tended by a lineage of flavor priests and their Grass-type partners who maintain an eternal garden of sacred plants. Visitors leave offerings of vanilla beans and flower petals in exchange for blessings of agricultural abundance and flavor inspiration. The shrine features unusual architecture that incorporates living plants as structural elements, with walls formed by carefully trained Tangrowth and Ferrothorn whose bodies have adapted to grow in architectural patterns.

## Cultural Practices

Vanilla Fields is known for its "Hand Pollination" tradition, where residents and their Bug-type partners perform the delicate task of manually pollinating vanilla orchids during the brief window when the flowers bloom. This practice, developed because vanilla orchids cannot self-pollinate naturally, has evolved into an art form with specific movements and rituals that honor the plant's sacred nature. The most skilled pollinators can reportedly achieve a 95% success rate, compared to the 10% that occurs in wild conditions.

The town observes a unique daily rhythm called "Flavor Clock" (Tlacualli Cahuitl), where activities shift with the changing aromatic profile of vanilla throughout the day. Morning is dedicated to harvesting flowers that bloom only for a few hours, midday focuses on curing processes that require peak sunlight, and evening involves sensory evaluation of the day's production. This natural cycle creates a community-wide synchronization that visitors find both structured and deeply connected to natural rhythms.

A distinctive feature of town life is the "Aroma Language" (Ahuiyac Tlahtolii), a communication system where specific scent combinations convey messages between vanilla cultivators. This olfactory language is enhanced by partnerships with Pokémon like Indeedee and Slurpuff who can detect and reproduce subtle scent variations. Experienced practitioners can reportedly exchange complex information about crop conditions and curing processes through carefully composed aromatic messages.

## Visitor Experience

Visitors are welcomed with the "Vanilla Greeting" (Vainilla Tlapalhuia) ceremony, where they receive a small vial of vanilla essence infused with energy from local Grass-type Pokémon. This essence is meant to be dabbed on the wrist and inhaled before meals to enhance flavor perception during their stay.

Tourists are encouraged to participate in daily "Sensory Awakening" sessions, where they learn to identify the complex aromatic compounds in vanilla through guided tastings led by Flavor Sages and their Pokémon partners. For more adventurous visitors, "Pollination Experiences" offer the opportunity to work alongside Bug-type Pokémon in the delicate art of hand-pollinating vanilla orchids during flowering season.

The town hosts special "Flavor Harmony" (Tlacualli Yolmelahualiztli) events during the full moon, where visitors with Grass or Bug-type partners can participate in group cultivation sessions designed to deepen the bond between trainer and Pokémon through shared agricultural work. These sessions are led by a Vanilla Sage and their partner—typically a Vileplume or Lurantis with decades of experience in vanilla cultivation.

Many visitors report unusual sensory experiences during their stay, such as heightened taste perception, synesthetic responses where flavors trigger visual experiences, and dreams filled with vivid aromas. The locals attribute these phenomena to the unique concentration of vanilla compounds in the air and the subtle influence of Psychic and Fairy-type Pokémon who are attracted to the town's aromatic environment.
