# Flavortown (Tlacuallocan)

This magnificent culinary metropolis serves as the capital of Xocoatl Baiyu, built around a series of massive stepped pyramid kitchens and flavor-infused aqueducts. With its substantial population of 40,000 humans and approximately 25,000 Pokémon citizens, Flavortown represents the pinnacle of harmony between Mesoamerican architectural traditions and Grass/Bug/Fairy-type Pokémon integration, creating a city that engages all the senses while honoring the sacred relationship between food, flavor, and spiritual nourishment.

## History

Flavortown was founded 600 years ago when the legendary Flavor Sovereign Montezuma and his partner Alcremie discovered a unique convergence of flavor ley lines—natural energy paths that enhance taste perception and food growth. According to ancient codices, Mew appeared to Montezuma in a dream, guiding him to this location where the soil, water, and air would produce the most harmonious flavors in the world.

The initial settlement was a simple collection of cooking hearths, but over generations, it expanded into a complex urban center organized around the five fundamental tastes. The city experienced a golden age 300 years ago when an alliance was formed with a colony of Ribombee and Vespiquen, who agreed to help with specialized pollination in exchange for protection and the creation of sacred honey reserves.

The most significant event in the city's history was the "Great Flavor Convergence" 200 years ago, when a rare astronomical alignment allegedly thinned the barrier between dimensions, allowing brief contact with the Digital World's Gourmet Zone. This event is commemorated in the annual Digital Flavor Convergence festival and led to the development of new culinary techniques that revolutionized the region's cuisine.
