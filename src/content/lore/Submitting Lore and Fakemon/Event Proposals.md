# Event Proposals
You can submit proposals for upcoming events, either that you would like to DM or that you would like me to DM. These are a fair bit of work, so feel free to reach out and see if I (or another player) may want to team up with you. (Though of course, there's nothing stopping you from doing the entirety of it of course.)
