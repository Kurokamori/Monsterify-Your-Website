# Faller Lore

##“  
### We where there, for a moment, it was like every world was one world, and yet nothing belonged.  
### I saw what was meant to be unseen. And then in a blink it was all gone and I was here.

### What happened?

Fallers.  
People not originally from this world.

It’s hard to say much about them because typically, they’re a very secretive sort. To most, they’re more myth than reality, an odd story their gran once told of a friend from another time, who spoke of a reality not quite like hers.  
But gran always did tell stories didn’t she?

And yet, lately, it’s become hard to escape the reality that some people are very, very out of place.

## Fallers

### Types :

- Paradox Fallers (From a time past or future)  
- Universe Crossers (From worlds quite like, and yet very different from our own)  
- Ultra Beasts (From completely alien and strange worlds)
