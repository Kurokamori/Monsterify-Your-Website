# Paradox Fallers

(these can be based on actual Paradox Pokemon, any pokemon with a Paradox Twist, or the general concept of ancient/future variations of monsters. I ask nicely that not all future paradox be robots. But I cannot and will not stop you.)

## What are Paradox Fallers?
Paradox fallers are individuals who are originally from a world that is notably older or younger than the current world, but mostly analogous to the world otherwise. Perhaps there where no pokemon or digimon, perhaps there where very few “humans” perhaps there where no halfwilds/alters but for the most part, it could be considered similar.

## Creating Paradox Fallers
There’s a lot to consider for these characters, as they’d likely have a lot of adjusting to do. Did they appear in the world a long time ago, and are used to this new land, or are they new to everything?  
Think about how a colonial american would feel in modern society, it’s more than just technology that has changed, clothing, customs, language, gender. Almost everything about humanity is different now than it was 200 years ago.

Feel free to have some fun with it. A character from a thousand years ago would probably love modern Rotom-Technology, perhaps Rotom didn’t even exist back then, or perhaps they think pokeballs are evil and abusive? 

Maybe however, they’re great at blending in.
