# Submitting Writing
Writing levels are calculated based on a combination of word count and complexity (Difficulty Modifier).<br>
When submitting writing, you will be prompted to fill out information, with the options for both 'Game Art' and 'Other Art'
<br> The bot will handle the calculation automatically, the difference between game art and other art is that for game writing each 'participant' recieves the level output, whereas with other writing the levels are split between the provided trainers/monsters.<br>

## Difficulty Modifier :
The Difficulty Modifier is a value that is added to the level output based on the complexity of the writing.
By default you should set this to 0
If you feel that the writing was uniquely difficult, complex, or worth note, you can scale from 1-3
