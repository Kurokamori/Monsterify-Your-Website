# Submitting References
References have a static reward regardless of artwork finish, so they're handled seperately.

## How to Submit References
Currently, reference submission is bot-only.

### For images to display correctly on the webiste References must be submitted to a specific website.
The website : https://imgbb.com/ is free and allows for you to upload artwork and link to it.
You need to use this website for trainers and monster references to display correctly.

## Submitting References :
Go to imgbb.com and upload your image.
Copy the link to the image.
Go to \!menu \-\> Submissions \-\> Reference Submissions \-\> Enter Reference at which point you will be prompted for a link (paste the link you copied) and monster name.
You can submit multiple monster references at once by following the format explained in the bot.
Once submitted, each monster will recieve 6 levels, and their trainer will get 200 coins.
