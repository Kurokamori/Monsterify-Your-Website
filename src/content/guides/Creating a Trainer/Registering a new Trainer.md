# Registering a New Trainer

#### I'm going to be honest, use the website. This guide used to include both the bot method and the website method, but it is just so much easier on the website. Use the website.

### Register an Account
If this is your first character, and haven't made an account yet, you'll need one. Don't worry I don't ask for your mother's maiden name, though you will need your Discord User ID (not your tag) if you don't know how to get this, ask me and I can grab it for you, this ties your characters to you in the discord bot so it's how the website can know who owns what.

#### How to Register
Registering is Simple
Open the website and navigate to the "Register" in the top right corner.
Enter the required information and click "Register".
You're now registered, and can access player specific features.

Currently there aren't too many, but more are to come.

### Registering Your New Trainer

Navigate up to profile, and then to 'Add Trainer'
Here there is a ton of fields, but only the name is required.
Fill out whatever you like (everything can be easily changed later) and then submit the form at the bottom of the screen.

At this point you will be redirected to your trainer's profile.

You should see 'Roll Starters' in the left navigation bar. Click it to roll your starters.

New trainers recieve 3 starters (because discord is weierd about things being less than three). As you claim each starter it will navigate you to the next set.

Renamming your mons is easy, but it requests a name so that there's something to insert into the database.

Once you have claimed all 3 starters, you're done and ready to start playing!
