# Garden

## Tend:

Take some time and tend to yourself.

Do these mental health replenishing activities or challenges to earn simple rewards (all prompts are mere suggestions, feel free to interpret them however you’d like. The idea is simply to spend some time on yourself. So long as you do that in some meaningful way, you’re good) and then claim rewards.

This can be done up to 3 times a day.

## Harvest:

Doing game activities like submitting art and writing earns you garden points. Once a day, you can harvest your garden for some extra berries and perhaps even some monsters.
