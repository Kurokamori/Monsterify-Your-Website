Alright, what can I get started for you today?

What are pastries, you ask? They’re like berries but better in every way\! You can use them to set the type/species/attribute to whatever you want. Want to look at the item list for what each one does?

## Requirements:

Species have to be Base Stages (No legendaries or mythicals) for pokemon, Any Yokai, or Digimon of Rookie Rank or lower

## Process:

Select your trainer, mon, and pastry; enter a value and see the magic happen\!

Thank you for your purchase, tips go over there for our excellent service, HaveAGreatDay, next in line\!
