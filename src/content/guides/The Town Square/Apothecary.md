# Apothecary (Berries)

A customer, a real life customer\! Welcome in\! It’s soooooooo nice to see an actual person’s face and not just the back of a Persim Berry\! Now don’t be shy, don’t be shy, come on up and tell me what you want\! If I don’t have it, I’ll get it\!

## Berry Use:

Berries have soooooooo many uses\! You can use them to remove traits or randomize them and we’ve even got this handy dandy lil guide, oo la la\! Exciting, right?

## Berry Process:

Choose a trainer.  
Choose a mon and berry.  
See the magic happen.  
Do it again  
And again  
And again  
Until eventually it would have been more economical to buy a pastry and just get the result you wanted.

Hey, don’t say that\! Berries are great without having to be cooked and mashed up, you jerk, hmph\!
