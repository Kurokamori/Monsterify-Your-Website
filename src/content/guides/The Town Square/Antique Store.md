# Antique Store

Welcome to my humble antique store, step inside and do *not* track mud with you. Take a look around and see what you like; if you have any questions, call me right over.

## Event Items:

Appraise Antiques : Get Random Rolls themed after holidays (some items currently don’t work, and i don’t know why yet. If you find an antique that doesn't appraise correctly, please let me know)  
Auction Antiques: Used to claim Event Adopts (there are not currently event adopts)

Satisfied? Great, you have a keen eye and I didn’t even need to stand up. A win-win, I would say.
