# Adventures (Roleplaying)

Centralized Roleplaying\! Woohoo\!

## Setup:

One player sets up the roleplay by selecting the Adventure tab, a region, and an area.

If you don’t want to use a region/area, simply select a random one and ignore what it says (“Custom” Is coming I just haven’t implemented it yet)

## Playing:

It will create a thread, anyone who messages in the thread is automatically participating.

“Next” will give a random encounter up to 3 times per adventure. (optional)

## Ending:

“End” can only be used by the original creator of the adventure and ends the session.

Adventures then calculate how many levels each person earned from their messages and allows you to assign them to trainers/pokemon. Happy roleplaying\!
