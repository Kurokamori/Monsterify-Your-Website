# Pirate’s Dock

Nyaaaaaaaaargh, ahoy, matey\! We smell goods on ya…give us all yer loot\!  
…  
Bahahaha, we’re just kitten around\! Come on up, take a look at our goods and you won’t be disappointed\!

## Features:

- Buy any random few items that they brought back from their latest haul, but they may or may not be at crazy prices (no, they’re nyot\!\! So rude\!)  
- Swab the Deck \- Help them do something less than fun (hey, it’s character building\! Go on, try a creative challenge, those still lives won’t draw themselves\!) and perhaps find an item or two that an absent minded pirate dropped (whatever you find is yours to keep, those be the pirate rules\!)  
- Go Fishing \- Go fishing with some of the pirates and take some time to breathe, do a longer challenge and be rewarded with whatever is at the end of your line, be it monster or ocean trash (the sea is unpredictable, like life. And sometimes lemons are just lemons, but sometimes they’re a great squirt weapon\!)

Got everything you’re looking for? Avast\! Come back soon, matey\!
