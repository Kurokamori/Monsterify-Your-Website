## Pokedex Entry
This powerful draconian creature once ruled the environments it lived in, powerful and revered.
It's been a long time now since then, and now Dracofrond are rarely seen at all, but those that are, are fiercely loyal and loving companions to their few and a dangerous enemy to the rest.
