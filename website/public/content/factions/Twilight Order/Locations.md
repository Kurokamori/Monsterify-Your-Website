# Locations

> Every Sanctuary is a door. What you walk into depends on how far you're willing to go.

## Overview

The Twilight Order operates through Sanctuaries — dual-purpose facilities that serve as both spiritual communes for members and public-facing shelters for Alters. The charitable front is genuine. The deeper purpose is not advertised.

## The Dusk Spire — Raven's Shadow

The Order's seat of power, located in the perpetual twilight of Raven's Shadow. A towering structure near Twilight Town that serves as the Exalted's meeting place, the Order's central archive, and the site of the most significant rituals. The Dusk Spire is not hidden — it's simply in a place most people would rather not go. The permanent half-light of the region suits the Order's aesthetic perfectly.

Only Speakers and above enter the Spire's upper levels. Lower floors house a functioning Sanctuary and shelter, open to anyone.

## Sanctuaries

### Hearthlight Sanctuary — Heimdal City, Hearthfall Commons
The Order's most visible and well-funded shelter. Provides housing, legal aid, and community services for Alters in the island's capital. Staffed primarily by Devoted. The public face the Order wants everyone to see — warm, welcoming, and doing undeniable good.

### Hollows Sanctuary — Xochitonal Village, Mictlan Hollows
A smaller, more spiritually focused Sanctuary near the ghost-type territories. Members here lean heavily into the Order's mystical practices. The boundary between spiritual study and something darker is thinner here than at other locations.

### Marshlight Sanctuary — Cauldron Village, Crowsfoot Marsh
A modest shelter serving the isolated marsh communities. The Order's presence here is quiet and practical — fewer rituals, more boots-on-the-ground aid for Alters in a region that doesn't have many other resources.

### Flame Sanctuary — Yagna Village, Agni Peaks
A Sanctuary built around the region's existing ritual fire traditions. The Order has integrated itself into local spiritual culture here more seamlessly than anywhere else, which makes the Spirit Keepers deeply uneasy.

## Outreach Centers

The Order runs smaller, unstaffed or lightly-staffed outreach points in several towns — a rented room here, a community board there. These serve as first contact points for Alters seeking help and are deliberately understated. No Order symbolism, no purple banners. Just a door and someone willing to listen.

## Notes

- The Order's Sanctuaries are open to anyone in need, regardless of faction or belief. Turning away someone who needs help would contradict the Order's public mission and damage their most valuable asset: their reputation.
- The Dusk Spire's full layout is unknown to anyone below Speaker rank. Rumors of deeper sub-levels are neither confirmed nor denied.
- The Order has no known presence on the Sky Isles or Conoocoo Archipelago, though Heralds have been spotted traveling in those directions.
