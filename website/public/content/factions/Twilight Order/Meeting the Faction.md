# Meeting the Faction

> Ascension requires sacrifice. The only question is whose.

## Overview

Spirits, Alters, and all other 'freaks' of the world deserve to be protected, relished, and perhaps even deified.

The Twilight Order is an organization of mystics and scholars dedicated to the study and preservation of the spiritual and metaphysical aspects of the world. They believe that by understanding and harnessing the power of Yokai and other supernatural entities, they can achieve a state of enlightenment and ascension beyond the limitations of mortal existence.

The Order believe themselves enlightened. Spiritually above all others. They see it as their duty to guide and protect those who they believe are capable of understanding their perspective, and to cleanse the world of those who would pervert or corrupt their understanding.

They see the subjugation of monsters as a necessary evil, a means to an end. A way to protect the world from itself. And they see the second-class treatment and ostracism of the Alters as a perversion of the natural order, and a stain on the world's soul that must be cleansed. 

But these are by no means people with clean hands. They have their own dark secrets, and their own brand of justice. In their belief that Alters and Fusions are advancements of the natural world, they believe them simply superior to 'purebloods', and deserving of whatever fate the Order doles out.

## Values and Beliefs

- They believe fusion monsters and alters to be advancements of nature. They are well aware of a time when only 'purebloods' and single species pokemon roamed the world, and they are thrilled to see that time gone. They see these advancements as direct acts of god. And blessed by god they "act in his name".

- They believe that the world is on the brink of a great spiritual awakening, and that they are the ones destined to lead it.

- They believe that by partnering with monsters they can understand them and work together to bring in a new order.


## Overall Goal(s)

- To instill a world order with Alters a top the social ladder, and fusion monsters, understood as the rightful good and natural progression of lifeforms, as the new apex predators.

- To cleanse the world of those who would pervert or corrupt their understanding of the natural order.

- To achieve a state of enlightenment and ascension beyond the limitations of mortal existence.
