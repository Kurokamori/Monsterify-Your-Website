# Joining and Leaving

> The door opens for those who are ready. It closes behind those who are not.

## Joining

### Requirements

- You must believe — or be willing to believe — that Alters and Fusions represent a divine advancement of the natural order.
- You must possess either spiritual sensitivity, scholarly knowledge of the metaphysical, or be an Alter yourself. The Order values all three, but at least one is non-negotiable.
- You must be willing to accept the Order's hierarchy and spiritual authority without reservation.

### The Process

The Twilight Order recruits through two distinct channels, each designed to attract a different kind of person.

#### The Guiding Hand — Public Recruitment

The Order operates a network of shelters, clinics, and advocacy centers for Alters across the archipelago. These are legitimate organizations that provide real help — safe housing, legal aid, medical care, and community for people who have spent their lives being treated as second-class citizens. The staff are kind. The services are free. The Order's name is nowhere on the building.

Over time, those who use these services are gently introduced to the Order's philosophy. Not forced — *guided*. A counselor mentions that Alters aren't just equal to purebloods, but perhaps something more. A support group discusses how the world would look if Fusions were understood as nature's next step rather than aberrations. It's never a pitch. It's always a conversation.

Those who resonate with these ideas are invited to meet others who think the same way. From there, the path into the Order unfolds naturally — study groups become initiation circles, mentors become spiritual guides, and before long, you're a member.

#### The Chosen — Direct Recruitment

For individuals the Order considers exceptional — powerful Alters, spiritually gifted individuals, scholars of the metaphysical — the approach is more direct. A member of the Order's inner circle will make contact personally, often revealing knowledge about the recruit that they shouldn't possess. The message is simple: *we see what you are, and we believe it makes you extraordinary.*

Direct recruits are fast-tracked through the Order's hierarchy and given access to deeper teachings earlier than those who enter through the public channel.

#### For Both Paths

1. **The Study** — All new members undergo a period of spiritual education. You'll learn the Order's theology, its history, and its vision for the world. This is part indoctrination and part genuine scholarship — the Order's archives are extensive and their understanding of spiritual phenomena is, grudgingly, respected even by the Spirit Keepers.
2. **The Rite of Twilight** — A ritual marking your formal entry into the Order. The specifics are secret, but it involves a spiritual bonding with a Yokai or other spirit-type monster and an oath of devotion to the Order's mission. Members report feeling "awakened" afterward. Critics call it conditioning.
3. **The Naming** — You receive an Order name — a spiritual title that reflects your role and potential within the hierarchy. Your birth name is not forbidden, but within the Order, it is considered... lesser.

### What You Get

- A community that genuinely believes you — especially if you are an Alter or Fused — are not just accepted but *sacred*.
- Access to the Order's spiritual teachings, archives, and ritual practices.
- Protection. The Order looks after its own with a ferocity that borders on frightening.
- A purpose. For people who have spent their lives being told they are wrong, broken, or unnatural, the Order offers the opposite — the conviction that you are the future.

## Leaving

### Voluntary Departure

The Twilight Order does not forbid leaving. They simply make it feel impossible.

Your community, your support system, your spiritual identity — all of it is built within the Order. Leaving means walking away from people who told you that you mattered when no one else would. For many members, especially Alters who joined through the shelters, the Order is the only family they've ever had.

Those who do leave are not pursued or threatened. They are simply... let go. With sadness. With concern. With the quiet, persistent reminder that the door is always open when you're ready to come home.

Former members report that the hardest part isn't the Order's reaction — it's the silence afterward. The support network disappears. The community moves on. You are alone in a world that the Order spent years teaching you was hostile.

The Order's public shelters remain available to former members. They are not petty about this. Help is help.

### Involuntary Removal

The Order will cast out members for:

- **Rejecting the divinity of Alters and Fusions.** The Order's core belief is non-negotiable. Questioning it in private is tolerated — briefly. Questioning it publicly is not.
- **Betraying the Order's secrets to outsiders.** The Order's rituals, membership, and inner workings are closely guarded. Exposure is treated as an attack on the community.
- **Harming an Alter.** The Order exists to elevate and protect Alters. A member who harms one has violated something the Order considers sacred.

Expelled members undergo a ritual of severance — a spiritual unbinding that removes their connection to the Order's network and, allegedly, some of the spiritual gifts cultivated during membership. Former members describe it as feeling hollow.

The Order does not pursue expelled members with violence. They don't need to. The social and spiritual consequences are considered sufficient.

### Returning After Leaving

Former members who left voluntarily are welcomed back with open arms and no questions. The Order considers every return a validation of its mission. You will undergo an abbreviated Study period and a renewal of your rite, but the process is designed to feel like a homecoming, not a re-evaluation.

Former members who were expelled may petition the Order's inner circle for readmission. These petitions are rare and almost never granted. The Order believes in transformation — but it also believes that some transformations cannot be undone.

## Notes

- The Twilight Order's public-facing charitable work is genuine and has helped thousands of Alters across the archipelago. This makes them frustratingly difficult for other factions to oppose openly.
- Dual faction membership is technically permitted but spiritually discouraged. The Order believes divided devotion is a symptom of incomplete awakening.
