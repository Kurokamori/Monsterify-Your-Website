## Overview

The Twilight Order dresses with intention. Every garment, color, and symbol carries spiritual meaning — or at least, the Order says it does. The result is an aesthetic that's beautiful, unsettling, and impossible to ignore. Members of the Order look like they belong to something, and that's exactly the effect they're going for.

## Order Colors

**Deep purple**, **twilight gold**, and **black**. Secondary accents in **silver** and **burnt orange** appear in ritual contexts. The palette evokes dusk — the space between day and night, the boundary the Order claims to walk.

## The Devoted

Full members dress in flowing, layered garments in Order colors — robes, tunics, wraps, and cloaks in purple and black, with gold embroidery or trim. The style is loose, comfortable, and vaguely ecclesiastical. Members are encouraged to personalize within the palette — the Order wants individuals, not clones.

The one required element is the **Twilight Pendant** — a small gold or bronze pendant shaped like a half-sun on the horizon, worn at the throat or chest. It identifies the wearer as a member and is given during the Rite of Twilight.

## Illuminates and Above

Higher-ranked members wear more elaborate versions of the standard attire. Illuminates add **silver threading** to their garments. Heralds — who operate in the outside world — often dress in more practical clothing but always incorporate the pendant and at least one element in Order colors.

Speakers wear **full ceremonial robes** during rituals and public appearances — rich purple with heavy gold embroidery and a hooded cloak. The effect is deliberately imposing.

## Shelter Staff

Members staffing the Order's public-facing shelters and clinics dress down considerably — simple, clean, approachable clothing with no overt Order symbolism. The pendant is worn but often tucked beneath a shirt. The shelters are meant to feel safe, not religious.

## Ritual Attire

Ceremonies call for specific garments: white robes for Seekers undergoing the Rite of Twilight, masked hoods for certain senior rites, and body paint or temporary markings in gold and silver. Ritual attire is provided by the Sanctuary and never worn outside of ceremony.

## Notes

- The Order's aesthetic is one of its most effective recruitment tools. Members look like they belong to something ancient, meaningful, and beautiful. For people — especially Alters — who have spent their lives feeling like outsiders, that visual belonging is powerful.
- Former members often struggle to stop wearing purple. The color becomes deeply personal. The Order knows this.
- The Exalted's attire, if they wear anything distinctive at all, has never been described by anyone outside the inner circle.
