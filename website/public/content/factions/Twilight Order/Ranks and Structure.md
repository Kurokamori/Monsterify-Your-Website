# Ranks and Structure

> Enlightenment is not a destination. It is a hierarchy.

## Overview

The Twilight Order is structured like a spiritual institution — part monastery, part church, part secret society. Advancement is framed as spiritual growth, each rank representing a deeper understanding of the Order's truth. Whether that growth is genuine or manufactured depends on who you ask.

## Ranks

### Seeker
A new member still undergoing the Study. Seekers attend teachings, participate in communal life, and begin their spiritual education. They are welcomed warmly and sheltered completely. The Order wants Seekers to feel safe — it makes the rest easier.

### Devoted
A full member who has completed the Rite of Twilight and received their Order name. The Devoted form the body of the Order — attending rituals, contributing to the community, staffing the shelters and clinics, and living according to the Order's teachings. Most members stay at this rank, and the Order insists this is perfectly fulfilling.

### Illuminate
A Devoted who has demonstrated deeper spiritual sensitivity and commitment. Illuminates are trusted with more of the Order's inner workings — sensitive rituals, restricted teachings, and the mentorship of Seekers. They begin to see the shape of things the Devoted are not shown.

### Herald
The Order's active agents in the world. Heralds carry out the faction's goals beyond the walls of their sanctuaries — recruiting, establishing new shelters, advocating for Alter rights, and handling situations that require the Order's direct intervention. Heralds operate with significant autonomy and report to the Speakers.

### Speaker
Senior leaders who oversee a region or major initiative. Speakers manage sanctuaries, guide Illuminates, direct Heralds, and serve as the Order's public voice when one is needed. Each Speaker is deeply embedded in the Order's theology and politics.

### The Exalted
The Order's inner circle. The Exalted set doctrine, approve major operations, and guard the Order's deepest secrets and most powerful rites. Their identities are known only to the Speakers and each other. The Exalted claim to commune directly with the spiritual forces the Order reveres. Whether this is true or theater is a question that has split more than one former member.

### The Envoy
The Order's representative to the regional leadership council. Always a Speaker, chosen by the Exalted. The Envoy presents the Order's public face — charitable, reasonable, concerned with Alter welfare. They are very good at this. The Envoy advocates for Alter protections, anti-discrimination policy, and spiritual freedom — causes that are genuinely hard to argue against, which is exactly the point.

## Sanctuaries

The Order operates from Sanctuaries — part temple, part commune, part shelter. Each Sanctuary serves as a home for members, a center for spiritual practice, and a public-facing clinic or shelter for Alters. They range from modest buildings in small towns to sprawling compounds in remote locations.

Each Sanctuary is led by a Speaker and operates semi-independently, though all follow the doctrine set by the Exalted.

## Notes

- Advancement within the Order is presented as spiritual readiness, not ambition. Members who seek promotion are told they aren't ready. Members who don't seek it are told they are.
- The Order's public-facing shelters are staffed primarily by Devoted and are genuinely helpful. The line between "charitable organization" and "recruitment pipeline" is invisible by design.
- Heralds are the rank most likely to interact with the outside world and other factions. They are unfailingly polite and deeply unsettling to people who know what the Order actually believes.
