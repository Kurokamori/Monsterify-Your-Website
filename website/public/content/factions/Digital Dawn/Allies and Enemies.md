# Allies and Enemies

# Overview

Digital Dawn sees the world in binary — you either understand the future, or you're standing in the way of it. Their relationships with other factions are colored entirely by one question: do you help us get closer to the Digital World, or do you slow us down?

# Allies

## Project Obsidian

Dawn's closest and most productive partnership. Both factions believe that nature's limits are meant to be surpassed, and their research interests overlap in ways that benefit both. Obsidian provides biological expertise and experimental data; Dawn provides computational power and digital infrastructure. Neither faction pretends the other is virtuous. They simply recognize that together, they can do things that neither could alone.

## Professor Koa's Lab

A more complicated alliance. The Lab has resources, data, and institutional credibility that Dawn desperately wants access to. Koa's researchers are brilliant, and some of their work on monster species directly feeds Dawn's understanding of digital lifeforms. The Lab tolerates Dawn because their technology is genuinely useful — but Dawn is careful not to reveal too much of their true ambitions to Koa's more idealistic staff.

## Nyakuza

The Nyakuza get things. Things that don't exist on official markets, things that fell off ships, things that were never supposed to leave certain facilities. Dawn needs all of it. In return, the Nyakuza get tech that makes their operations smoother, faster, and harder to trace. It's a partnership built on mutual benefit and a shared disdain for rules.

# Enemies

# Neutral

## Rangers

Rangers see Dawn's experiments as a threat to the natural order. Dawn sees Rangers as technophobic gatekeepers clinging to a world that's already changed. Rangers have shut down Dawn field operations more than once, citing environmental concerns. Dawn considers this harassment. The hostility is professional but real — Rangers are one of the few factions that actively monitors Dawn's movements.

## Spirit Keepers

The Keepers believe in spiritual balance. Dawn believes in digital supremacy. These worldviews are fundamentally incompatible. The Keepers see Dawn's work as a perversion of natural energy, and Dawn sees the Keepers as superstitious relics refusing to evolve. They don't fight often, but when their interests collide — usually over sites with unusual energy signatures — things get heated fast.

## Ranchers

Ranchers care about the land, about honest work, and about treating monsters with simple decency. Dawn's attitude toward non-digital monsters as "inferior" is deeply offensive to Rancher sensibilities. Dawn, meanwhile, considers Ranchers quaint and irrelevant. It's not a dramatic rivalry — more a fundamental incompatibility of values that ensures neither side will ever see eye to eye.

## The Tribes

The Tribes want isolation and preservation. Dawn wants access and progress. Tribal lands sit on some of the most unexplored territory in the archipelago, and Dawn suspects that several tribal sites have digital energy signatures worth investigating. The Tribes have made it very clear that Dawn is not welcome. Dawn has not always listened. Relations are poor and getting worse.

## League

The League doesn't understand Dawn and doesn't particularly try to. Dawn's technology is occasionally useful, their philosophy is occasionally concerning, and their operations are occasionally illegal. The League watches from a comfortable distance, content to intervene only if Dawn crosses a clear line. Dawn tolerates this arrangement because picking a fight with the League's infrastructure would be spectacularly stupid.

## Tamers

This one stings. Tamers share Dawn's connection to digital energy and digital lifeforms, but refuse to embrace Dawn's vision. They protect digital lifeforms but won't weaponize them. They believe in the Digital World but won't pursue it. Dawn sees Tamers as wasted potential — kindred spirits who chose to be small. Tamers see Dawn as friends who went too far. The relationship is polite, distant, and quietly sad.

## Twilight Order

Two secretive factions with grand cosmic ambitions who happen to be pursuing completely different cosmoses. Dawn wants the Digital World; the Order wants spiritual ascension. Their paths don't cross, their interests don't overlap, and neither faction sees the other as relevant to its mission. They pass like ships in the night, occasionally nodding in acknowledgment that the other exists.
