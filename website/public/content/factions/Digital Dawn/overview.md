# Digital Dawn

Part zealots, part cyber-criminals, Digital Dawn was born from one of the first encounters with a Digimon. They seek to find or create the Digital World — a vast parallel expanse they believe is their destiny to control. With unrivaled technological prowess and the unique ability to harness Digimon for digital attacks, they are a force to be reckoned with.
