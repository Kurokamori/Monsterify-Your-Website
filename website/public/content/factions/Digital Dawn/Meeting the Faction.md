# Meeting the Faction

> The physical world is but mere hardware. It is up to us to write the software.

## Overview

The world is changing, the world is expanding, and Digital Dawn seem to be the only ones ready to explore it.

Digital Dawn was born as the world changed, from one of the first encounters with a Digimon. They where told of the Digital World, a vast expanse parallel to our own world, which, with the right inclination, could be completely controlled by the first humans to arrive.

Since then, Digimon have become common place in the world, but still, no one has found this 'Digital World' that they have heard of. Grasping at the straws of stories old, Digital Dawn are part zealots and part cyber-criminals.

The organization works to achieve one of two goals, either to find the Digital World, or to create it. With an understanding of technology rivaled by none, and the unique ability to harnass Digimon for digital attacks, Digital Dawn are a force to be reckoned with.

## Values and Beliefs

- They firmly believe a true 'Digital World' parallel world exists and that it is their destiny to find it.

- They believe themselves uniquely ordained to work with technology and Digimon, and that if they're able to hack someone, con someone, or otherwise leverage intellect or technology to get what they want, it is because they are destined to do so.

- Digimon are tools and allies, not pets. They are to be respected as partners, with a human intelligence, but not to be indulged.

- Monsters other than Digimon who are not capable of assisting in their goals are inferior, and while fine pets or weapons, do not ulitimately align with their goals.

## Overall Goal(s)

- Find the Digital World, or create it.
    - Use the Digital World to expand human control over the physical world.
    - Profit from the expansion of the Digital World.
    - Control the Digital World and whatever lifeforms happen to be in it.

- Create a Digimon/Digital Monster supremecy
    - Show others of this world that Digimon are superior to other monster classes and should be treated uniquely, and recieve unique legal and social protections.
