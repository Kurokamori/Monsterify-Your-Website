# Locations

> If you know where we are, we've already moved.

## Overview

Digital Dawn does not have public locations. Their infrastructure is designed to be invisible, mobile, and disposable. What follows is what outside factions have been able to piece together — which means Dawn has probably already changed half of it.

## Suspected Central Node

### Unknown — Believed to be in or near Vulcan City, Hephaestus Forge
Intelligence from the League and Rangers suggests Dawn's primary server infrastructure and senior leadership operate somewhere in the industrial district of Hephaestus Forge. The region's heavy power grid, dense electromagnetic interference, and culture of metalwork and machinery provide ideal cover for Dawn's technical operations. Nothing has been confirmed. Dawn likes it that way.

## Known Cell Operating Areas

Dawn cells have been identified operating in the following regions, though specific locations shift frequently:

- **Thunderbird Heights** — Wakinyan City and surrounding areas. The region's electrical infrastructure and storm activity provide natural cover for Dawn's digital operations.
- **Hephaestus Forge** — Vulcan City and Forge Town. Hardware acquisition, custom manufacturing, and infrastructure maintenance.
- **Oracle's Sanctum** — Delphi City. A research-focused cell studying the intersection of psychic phenomena and digital energy. The Sanctum's unusual energy signature interests Dawn greatly.
- **Heimdal City** — Hearthfall Commons. Intelligence gathering. Dawn keeps eyes on the League, the Lab, and the regional council from the island's capital.

## Safe Houses

Dawn maintains a rotating network of safe houses across the island — rented rooms, abandoned buildings, and sympathetic contacts who ask no questions. Safe house locations are known only to the cell that uses them and are changed regularly.

## Notes

- Dawn has no presence on the Conoocoo Archipelago or Sky Isles. The lack of digital infrastructure makes both territories operationally useless to them — and, more importantly, spiritually and technologically alien in ways that unsettle even Dawn's most confident operatives.
- If the League or Rangers discover a Dawn location, standard protocol is immediate evacuation. Equipment is wiped or destroyed. The cell relocates within hours.
