# Uniforms

> Look like everyone else. Until it's time not to.

## Overview

Digital Dawn has the most codified uniform system of any faction — because looking professional is part of the cover, and looking uniform is part of the control. When Dawn operates, its members are visually cohesive, difficult to identify individually, and immediately recognizable to each other.

## Dawn Colors

**Black** and **electric cyan**, with **white** accents. The palette is sharp, modern, and deliberately inhuman. Dawn wants to look like the future, not like another island faction.

## The Standard Operative Kit

All operatives receive a standard-issue set upon integration into a cell:

- **The Shell** — A fitted, high-collared jacket in matte black with cyan accent lines along the seams and collar. Lightweight, modular, and designed with hidden pockets and cable routing for personal devices. The Shell is the most recognizable piece of Dawn attire — sleek enough to pass as civilian fashion, distinctive enough that other Dawn members spot it instantly.
- **Visor** — A slim, tinted visor or half-mask in black with a cyan display strip. Functional — most are equipped with a heads-up display synced to the operative's Digimon and the cell's communication channel. Doubles as identity concealment during operations.
- **Gloves** — Black, thin-profile gloves with conductive fingertips for device interaction. Practical and ubiquitous.

## Variations by Role

- **Technicians** add a cyan shoulder stripe to their Shell.
- **Cell Leaders** wear an inverted color scheme — cyan Shell with black accents — distinguishing them within the cell but not to outsiders.
- **Architects and above** have no additional uniform markers. At that level, being identifiable is a liability.

## Off-Duty

Dawn operatives in civilian life dress however they please, but many retain elements of the aesthetic — dark clothing, tech accessories, the occasional cyan accent. It's less a requirement and more a habit. Dawn's visual identity seeps in.

## Notes

- The Shell is designed to be worn over civilian clothing, making it easy to put on or remove quickly. Dawn operatives can go from "random person on the street" to "uniformed operative" in seconds.
- All uniform pieces are manufactured internally. Dawn does not source its gear from outside suppliers.
- Wearing Dawn attire outside of operations without authorization is a disciplinary issue. The uniform exists for a purpose, not for fashion.
