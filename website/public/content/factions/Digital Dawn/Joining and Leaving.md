# Joining and Leaving

> We don't need believers. We need builders.

## Joining

### Requirements

- You must possess meaningful technical skill — programming, network engineering, hardware modification, or digital energy manipulation. Enthusiasm alone won't open the door.
- You must have a Digimon partner, or be willing to acquire one. Digital Dawn does not take members who cannot interface with the digital.
- You must be comfortable operating outside the law. Digital Dawn does not pretend to play by the rules of a world they consider obsolete.

### The Process

Digital Dawn recruits actively, but selectively. They are always watching — monitoring digital traffic, scanning for unusual Digimon activity, and keeping tabs on anyone who demonstrates aptitude with technology beyond what the islands' general population can manage.

#### Scouted Recruitment

The most common path. A Dawn operative identifies a person of interest and makes contact — usually digitally. You might receive an encrypted message, an invitation to a private server, or a Digimon that arrives at your doorstep carrying a data chip. The message is always the same: a problem to solve. Crack it, and you've earned a conversation.

#### Self-Initiated Contact

Rarer, but respected. If you've found a way to contact Digital Dawn on your own, that itself demonstrates the kind of resourcefulness they value. You'll still need to prove your worth — expect a more rigorous vetting process, as the organization is deeply paranoid about infiltration.

#### For Both Paths

1. **The Proof** — You will be given a technical challenge tailored to your skillset. This is not a test of knowledge — it's a test of problem-solving under pressure. Dawn wants to see how you think, not what you've memorized.
2. **The Interview** — A senior operative will meet with you, sometimes in person, sometimes through a digital proxy. They will assess your ideology as much as your skill. Dawn wants people who believe in the mission, not just mercenaries.
3. **The Integration** — Accepted recruits are assigned to a cell — a small, semi-autonomous team with a specific operational focus. You'll receive a Dawn handle, encrypted access to the organization's internal network, and your first assignment. Your real name is never used within the organization.

### What You Get

- Access to the most advanced technology on the archipelago, much of it custom-built by Dawn operatives.
- A Digimon partner program — Dawn maintains its own breeding and acquisition network for Digimon, and members have priority access.
- Encrypted communication channels, safe houses, and operational support across the islands.
- A seat at the frontier of digital discovery. Whatever the Digital World turns out to be, Dawn will be the first ones there.

## Leaving

### Voluntary Departure

Digital Dawn does not make leaving easy, because leaving means carrying their secrets with you.

If you wish to leave, you must formally request a discharge from your cell leader. A debrief process follows — Dawn will determine what sensitive information you hold and take steps to ensure it cannot be used against them. This may involve memory-affecting technology, digital wipes of your personal devices, or simply a very pointed conversation about what happens to people who talk.

If Dawn is satisfied that you won't compromise operations, you'll be released. Your handle is deactivated, your network access is revoked, and your Digimon partner remains yours — they are partners, not property, and Dawn respects that bond even when severing others.

Former members who leave cleanly are monitored for a period. Not threatened. Just watched. Dawn calls this "the cooldown."

### Involuntary Removal

Digital Dawn will remove members for:

- **Incompetence that endangers the cell.** Dawn operates in hostile territory. If your mistakes put others at risk repeatedly, you become a liability. Liabilities are cut loose — quickly and without sentiment.
- **Betrayal.** Feeding information to the League, the Rangers, or any other faction. Dawn's response to betrayal is proportional to the damage caused, and they are very good at calculating damage.
- **Mistreating Digimon.** Dawn views Digimon as superior partners, not disposable tools. Members who abuse their digital partners are removed and blacklisted from the Digimon partner program permanently.

The consequences of involuntary removal vary. At minimum, you lose everything — access, handle, network. At worst, Dawn ensures you are no longer capable of being a threat. They are deliberately vague about what this means.

### Returning After Leaving

Former members who left through the formal discharge process may petition their old cell leader for reinstatement. This is uncommon but not unheard of. You will be re-vetted from scratch, and your previous clearance level is not restored automatically.

Former members who were removed do not return. Digital Dawn does not offer second chances to people it has already decided are threats.

## Notes

- Digital Dawn operates in cells specifically so that no single member can compromise the entire organization. Even long-standing members may not know the identities or locations of operatives outside their own cell.
- Dual faction membership is not forbidden but is viewed with extreme suspicion. Dawn assumes anyone with divided loyalties will eventually choose the other side.
