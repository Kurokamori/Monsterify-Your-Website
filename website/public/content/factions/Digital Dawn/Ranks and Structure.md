# Ranks and Structure

> You don't need to see the whole machine. You just need to know your part runs.

## Overview

Digital Dawn is built on compartmentalization. No single member sees the full picture — by design. The organization operates through isolated cells, each with a specific mission, connected by encrypted channels that only flow upward. It's efficient, paranoid, and extremely difficult to dismantle.

## Ranks

### Operative
The entry rank. Operatives carry out assignments given by their cell leader — data collection, network intrusion, Digimon acquisition, surveillance, or fieldwork. You know your cell. You know your handle. You don't know much else, and that's intentional.

### Technician
An Operative who has demonstrated sustained technical excellence and reliability. Technicians take on more complex assignments, may lead small sub-tasks within a cell, and are trusted with higher-clearance information. Most Dawn members reach this rank and stay here.

### Cell Leader
The commander of an individual cell. Cell Leaders receive directives from above, translate them into operations for their team, and report results upward. They have full authority over their cell's operations and significant latitude in how they execute directives. A good Cell Leader protects their people. A great one makes sure their people never know they needed protecting.

### Architect
Senior operatives who oversee multiple cells within a region or operational domain. Architects coordinate between cells without revealing their identities to the operatives below — communication flows through Cell Leaders. They design operations, allocate resources, and ensure that the individual pieces of Dawn's work fit together into something larger.

### The Inner Circuit
The leadership core of Digital Dawn. The Inner Circuit sets the faction's strategic direction, manages its most sensitive operations, and guards whatever Dawn knows about the Digital World. Membership in the Inner Circuit is never confirmed publicly. Even most Architects don't know who sits on it.

## Cells

The cell is Dawn's fundamental unit. Each cell is a small team — typically four to eight operatives — with a focused operational purpose. Cells are categorized by function:

- **Acquisition** — Obtaining Digimon, technology, and data through whatever means necessary.
- **Research** — Studying digital energy, the Digital World, and Digimon capabilities.
- **Intrusion** — Network penetration, surveillance, and intelligence gathering.
- **Infrastructure** — Maintaining Dawn's communication network, safe houses, and technical assets.

Cells do not interact with each other directly. If two cells need to coordinate, the directive comes from an Architect.

## Notes

- Digital Dawn has no formal Envoy to the regional leadership council. They do not recognize the region's governing structure and see no reason to participate in it. When Dawn wants something from the council, they acquire it through other means.
- Ranks are based on trust and results, not seniority. A newly recruited Operative who proves exceptional can rise faster than a Technician who's been coasting.
- The compartmentalized structure means that the loss of any single cell — even a Cell Leader — does not compromise the broader organization. This is the point.
