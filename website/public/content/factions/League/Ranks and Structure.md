# Ranks and Structure

> Every title is earned. Every rank is proven. There are no shortcuts on this ladder.

## Overview

The League operates on a meritocratic hierarchy. Your rank is your record, and your record is public. Advancement comes through competition — gym challenges, tournament placements, and contest victories. Political maneuvering and social connections will get you a nice seat in the stands, but they won't move you up.

## Battle Track

### Unranked Trainer
Where everyone starts. You've registered with the League and received your trainer card. You can enter exhibition matches and open tournaments, but you have no standing yet. Most trainers stay here — and that's perfectly fine.

### Ranked Trainer
You've won enough sanctioned matches to earn a numerical rank among all League participants in the region. Your wins and losses are tracked publicly. You can now enter restricted tournaments with real prizes and title opportunities.

### Gym Challenger
You've declared your intent to challenge the gym circuit. This is a commitment — once you start, the League expects you to see it through or formally withdraw. Gym challengers receive a badge case and access to League training facilities between challenges.

### Badge Holder
You've defeated one or more gym leaders. Each badge is a public mark of achievement, and the more you hold, the more doors open. Badge holders are respected figures in League cities and are often asked to mentor younger trainers.

### Elite Challenger
You've collected all required badges and earned the right to challenge the Elite Four. This is where most competitive careers peak. Even reaching this stage is considered a tremendous honor.

### Champion
You've defeated the Elite Four and the reigning Champion. There is only one at a time. The Champion is the living symbol of everything the League believes in — that strength, strategy, and heart can carry anyone to the top. Champions serve until defeated or until they step down.

## Contest Track

### Unranked Coordinator
New to contests. Can enter open showcases and exhibition performances.

### Ranked Coordinator
Earned enough contest points to hold a regional ranking. Access to invitational contests and special performance venues.

### Ribbon Holder
Won one or more official contest ribbons. Each ribbon represents mastery of a specific contest category — beauty, cleverness, toughness, coolness, or cuteness.

### Grand Coordinator
Collected all required ribbons. Eligible to enter the Grand Festival, the highest contest event the League hosts.

## Administrative Roles

### Gym Leader
Appointed by the League Council. Gym leaders are both gatekeepers and teachers — their job is to test challengers, not to crush them. Each gym leader specializes in a type or style and maintains a gym in a League-affiliated city. It's a prestigious role that demands both strength and patience.

### Elite Four
The four strongest trainers beneath the Champion. They serve as the League's senior battlers, advisors, and — when necessary — enforcers. Elite Four members are expected to be active in League governance and are often dispatched to handle threats too large for local gym leaders.

### League Council
The governing body. Composed of senior gym leaders, retired Champions, and appointed officials. The Council sets rules, approves tournaments, manages funding, and makes the big decisions. They don't fight much anymore, but underestimate them at your peril.

## Notes

- Battle rank and contest rank are tracked separately. A trainer can hold high standing in both, but the ladders don't cross.
- Rank is not permanent. Inactivity, repeated losses, or conduct violations can result in demotion.
- All ranked matches are officiated. Unsanctioned battles do not count toward League standing.
