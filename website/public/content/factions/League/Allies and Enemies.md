# Allies and Enemies

# Overview

The League sits at the center of the archipelago's political web. As the closest thing the islands have to a governing body, nearly every faction has *some* relationship with them — whether they like it or not. The League's stance is simple: if you keep the peace, you're welcome. If you don't, you'll hear from them.

# Allies

## Ranchers

Steady, dependable, and refreshingly uncomplicated. Ranchers feed the islands, tend the land, and raise monsters with a quiet competence the League deeply respects. They don't ask for much and they don't cause trouble — which makes them the League's favorite kind of neighbor. Rancher-raised monsters are famously well-tempered, and more than a few gym leaders got their start on a ranch. The League funds rural infrastructure in Rancher territory, and Ranchers supply League events with provisions without complaint. It works.

## Rangers

The League's most natural ally. Rangers enforce conservation law across the wilds, and the League is more than happy to fund that work in exchange for reliable intelligence on what's happening beyond the cities. Rangers attend League tournaments as honored guests, and many League trainers retire into Ranger service. The relationship is old, comfortable, and mutually beneficial — though Rangers occasionally bristle at being treated like a branch office.

## Tamers

Tamers and the League share a deep respect for the bond between trainer and monster. Where the League channels that bond into competition, Tamers channel it into partnership and daily life. Many Tamers participate in League exhibitions and contests, and the League considers them kindred spirits — people who understand that the relationship with your monster *is* the point. Tamers are always welcome at League events, and their insights on monster behavior are quietly invaluable to gym leaders.

## Koa's Laboratory

The Lab provides the League with research, species data, and starter distributions. In return, the League funds expeditions, shares battle data, and keeps the Lab's fieldwork protected. It's a professional relationship with genuine warmth underneath — League officials have enormous respect for the Professor's work, and Koa's researchers are some of the most enthusiastic spectators at tournaments.

# Enemies

## Project Obsidian

Obsidian operates with a level of secrecy the League finds unacceptable and a willingness to push ethical boundaries the League finds dangerous. Their experiments on monsters, their closed-door research, their refusal to submit to oversight — all of it sets the League's teeth on edge. The League has attempted to bring Obsidian under regulation multiple times. Obsidian has declined every time. Official stance: active opposition, constrained only by the fact that Obsidian hasn't done anything *provably* catastrophic. Yet.

## Digital Dawn

Dawn's philosophy about digitizing monsters and blurring the line between the virtual and the real strikes the League as fundamentally wrong. Monsters are living creatures, not data to be uploaded and optimized. The League views Dawn's work as a threat to the natural order of trainer-monster relationships and has publicly condemned several of their projects. Dawn, for their part, considers the League a dinosaur clinging to tradition. The feeling is mutual.

## Twilight Order

The Order's secrecy, their rituals, their insistence on operating outside any authority but their own — the League has never been comfortable with it. When the Order's activities were limited to quiet mysticism, the League looked the other way. But recent movements suggest the Order is expanding its influence, and the League doesn't appreciate power structures it can't see into. Trust is low. Patience is lower.

## Nyakuza

Pirates, smugglers, and charmingly unapologetic criminals. The League has tried to crack down on the Nyakuza more than once and learned the hard way that catching smoke is easier. The Nyakuza steal goods, undermine trade routes, and operate entirely outside the law — all while grinning about it. The League officially condemns everything they do. Unofficially, they've accepted that Pirate's Bay isn't going anywhere. But don't mistake resignation for tolerance — League officials still seize Nyakuza contraband on sight, and any pirate caught in League territory is dealt with swiftly.

# Neutral

## Spirit Keepers

The League respects tradition but doesn't entirely understand the Spirit Keepers' approach to monsters. Treating them as sacred beings rather than partners feels excessive to League sensibilities, but they recognize the Keepers' deep knowledge and genuine reverence. The two factions rarely interact directly, which suits both just fine. When they do cross paths, it's cordial — the kind of politeness between people who know they'll never agree but see no reason to fight about it.

## The Tribes

Mutual respect from a distance. The Tribes predate the League by centuries, and the League is wise enough to acknowledge that. Tribal lands are left alone, tribal customs are honored, and the League doesn't try to extend its authority into Tribal territory. In return, the Tribes don't challenge League governance elsewhere. It's an old understanding, rarely spoken of and never broken.
