# Locations

> Wherever there's a battlefield, the League has already built a roof over it.

## Headquarters

### League Hall — Heimdal City, Hearthfall Commons
The League's central headquarters and seat of the League Council. The Hall houses administrative offices, the main tournament arena, the Hall of Champions (a gallery of every Champion's portrait and record), and the Elite Four challenge chambers. If the League is a government, this is its capital building.

## The Elite Four Challenge

Located within League Hall in Heimdal City. Challengers who have collected all eight badges may register for the gauntlet — four consecutive battles against the Elite Four, followed by a final match against the reigning Champion. The challenge chambers are purpose-built arenas deep within the Hall, each customized to the current Elite Four member's style.

## Gyms

League gyms are spread across Conoco Island, one for each type-dominant region, each led by a Gym Leader who specializes in that type. Gym Leaders are as much teachers as gatekeepers — their job is to test challengers, not to wall them off.

| Gym | Location | Type | Badge | Gym Leader |
|-----|----------|------|-------|------------|
| Hearthfall Gym | Heimdal City, Hearthfall Commons | Normal | Hearth Badge | **Sigrid** — Warm, patient, and deceptively strong. Believes every trainer deserves a fair first fight. |
| Agni Gym | Agni City, Agni Peaks | Fire | Pyre Badge | **Surya** — Intense and ritualistic. Treats every gym battle as a sacred trial by flame. |
| Poseidon Gym | Atlantis City, Poseidon's Reach | Water | Trident Badge | **Nereus** — Calm, strategic, and impossibly hard to read. Fights like the tide — slow until it isn't. |
| Thunderbird Gym | Wakinyan City, Thunderbird Heights | Electric | Storm Badge | **Kaminari** — Loud, fast, and thrilling. Her battles are half sport, half lightning show. |
| Demeter Gym | Eleusis City, Demeter's Grove | Grass | Harvest Badge | **Thalia** — Quiet and methodical. Will outpace you with patience you didn't know was a weapon. |
| Jötun Gym | Utgard City, Jötun Tundra | Ice | Glacier Badge | **Brynhild** — Stoic, enduring, and fights like a blizzard — you won't see the end coming until you're already buried. |
| Kshatriya Gym | Kurukshetra City, Kshatriya Arena | Fighting | Valor Badge | **Arjun** — Honorable to a fault. Will shake your hand before and after he dismantles your team. |
| Crowsfoot Gym | Witchwood City, Crowsfoot Marsh | Poison | Blight Badge | **Hemlock** — Unsettling, precise, and smiles too much. Her battles are slow deaths by a thousand small advantages. |
| Terra Madre Gym | Tellus City, Terra Madre Basin | Ground | Bedrock Badge | **Adon** — Steady and immovable. Speaks softly, hits like a landslide. His gym floor is raw earth. |
| Quetzal Gym | Tenochtitlan Sky, Quetzal Winds | Flying | Plume Badge | **Cielo** — Graceful and relentless. Fights from elevated platforms and expects you to keep up. |
| Oracle Gym | Delphi City, Oracle's Sanctum | Psychic | Oracle Badge | **Pythia** — Unnerving. Seems to know your strategy before you do. Whether that's skill or something else, nobody's sure. |
| Anansi Gym | Kumasi City, Anansi Woods | Bug | Silk Badge | **Ayo** — Patient and theatrical. Her gym is a web of puzzles you solve before you ever reach her. |
| Stoneheart Gym | Avalon City, Stoneheart Cliffs | Rock | Monolith Badge | **Menhir** — Ancient, immovable, and rumored to have held the position longer than anyone can remember. |
| Mictlan Gym | Mictlampa City, Mictlan Hollows | Ghost | Veil Badge | **Catrina** — Serene and unsettling in equal measure. Battles in her gym feel like they're happening somewhere else entirely. |
| Long Valley Gym | Tianlong City, Long Valley | Dragon | Sovereign Badge | **Longwei** — Scholarly, powerful, and the closest thing to a wall between you and the Elite Four. |
| Raven Gym | Corvus City, Raven's Shadow | Dark | Eclipse Badge | **Morrigan** — Cunning, sharp-tongued, and fights dirty within the rules. If there's a loophole, she's already through it. |
| Hephaestus Gym | Vulcan City, Hephaestus Forge | Steel | Anvil Badge | **Vulcas** — Methodical and unbreakable. His team is as precisely engineered as the forge-work his city is famous for. |
| Seelie Gym | Titania City, Seelie Courts | Fairy | Glamour Badge | **Elowen** — Whimsical and devastating. Don't let the flowers and laughter fool you — she hasn't lost in months. |

## Contest Halls

The League operates contest venues across the island for coordinators pursuing the ribbon circuit.

- **Hearthfall Contest Hall** — Heimdal City. The largest and most popular venue. Hosts all five contest categories regularly.
- **Seelie Stage** — Titania City, Seelie Courts. Specializes in Beauty and Cuteness contests. The fairy-lit venue is considered the most visually stunning on the island.
- **Colosseum Showcase** — Kurukshetra City, Kshatriya Arena. Hosts Toughness and Coolness contests. Doubles as an exhibition battle venue.
- **Oracle Amphitheater** — Delphi City, Oracle's Sanctum. Hosts Cleverness contests and experimental performance formats.
- **Tidal Stage** — Atlantis City, Poseidon's Reach. An underwater-domed arena where performances play with light, water, and pressure. Popular for Beauty and Coolness contests.
- **Stormlight Arena** — Wakinyan City, Thunderbird Heights. An open-air stage where performers work with (and against) the region's natural electrical charge. Coolness and Toughness contests thrive here.
- **Silk Theater** — Kumasi City, Anansi Woods. An intimate venue woven into the canopy. Known for Cleverness and Cuteness contests with unusually creative staging.
- **Frost Pavilion** — Utgard City, Jötun Tundra. An ice-walled amphitheater where performances shimmer against frozen surfaces. Beauty and Cleverness contests excel here — the acoustics are unreal.
- **Jade Court** — Tianlong City, Long Valley. A refined, pagoda-style theater with dragon-scale mosaics. Hosts all categories but draws the most prestigious Coolness and Beauty coordinators.
- **Harvest Ring** — Eleusis City, Demeter's Grove. An open-air stage surrounded by living gardens that change with the season. Cuteness and Beauty contests are the local favorites.
- **Shadowplay Hall** — Corvus City, Raven's Shadow. A dimly lit theater where coordinators perform with silhouette, illusion, and dramatic lighting. Cleverness and Coolness contests only — Cuteness doesn't survive the atmosphere.
- **Forge Crucible** — Vulcan City, Hephaestus Forge. An industrial stage with working gears and steam vents as set pieces. Toughness and Coolness contests with a mechanical edge.
- **Veillight Stage** — Mictlampa City, Mictlan Hollows. A hauntingly beautiful venue where spirit lights drift through the audience. Beauty and Cleverness contests here have a reputation for being unforgettable — and slightly eerie.

### The Grand Festival

The Grand Festival — the pinnacle of the contest circuit — is held annually at League Hall in Heimdal City. Coordinators who have collected all required ribbons are eligible to compete for the title of Grand Coordinator.

## Notes

- Gym order is not fixed. Challengers may tackle gyms in any sequence, though most trainers find the later gyms significantly harder.
- League facilities (healing stations, training grounds, equipment shops) are available in every city that hosts a gym.
