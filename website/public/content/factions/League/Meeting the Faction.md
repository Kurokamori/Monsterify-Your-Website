# Meeting the Faction

> Anyone can love a monster -- not anyone can defend that love with honor.

## Overview

The League doesn't hide what it is. It's the oldest, most visible power structure in the archipelago, and it wants you to know that.

Built on a foundation of gyms, tournaments, and ranked competition, the League believes that battle is the most honest language in the world. Your title, your background, your connections — none of it matters on the field. Only results do. That philosophy has made them the closest thing the islands have to a legitimate government, and they wear that authority with the quiet confidence of people who have never seriously been challenged.

They are not corrupt. They are not cruel. They are, however, deeply invested in remaining exactly what they are — and anyone threatening that stability will find the League's patience runs out faster than its power does.

The league runs a combination of 'exhibition battles', 'gym battles', 'tournaments', and 'ranked battles' to serve different purposes. Some like the exhibition matches are for the entertainment of participants, while conversly tournaments are ranked competitions with real rewards and standing in the league.

While gym battles are the path to the elite four, tournaments reward competitors not only with unique titles, but with 'rank' which allows them to advance throughout their standing of all league participants in the region.

Contests are also held under the league, and function much the same way. Their rank pool is seperate from battlers, but is otherwise the same.

## Values and Beliefs

- Strength, Endurance, and Honor are the most important values in life.

- Monsters are good pets, solid friends, and powerful companions. To harm them is wrong but to diefy them is silly.

- Words and Titles are only as valuable as the competitions with which you earn them.

- Order and Structure are what keeps the islands from tearing itself apart.

## Overall Goal(s)

- Maintain the lion's share control over the Region and continue to instill and uphold its beliefs.

- Root out and resolve all evil doers, corrupt organizations, and otherwise those that aim to impede upon the tranquil peace of the League's current existance.

- Identify and cultivate the strongest and/or cleverest trainers through tournaments and contests.
