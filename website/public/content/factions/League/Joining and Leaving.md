# Joining and Leaving

> The door is open. Walking through it is the easy part.

## Joining

### Requirements

- You must be a registered trainer or coordinator with at least one bonded monster.
- You must visit a League-affiliated gym or registration office in person. No remote applications.
- You must pass a basic competency assessment — not a battle, just a demonstration that you and your monster can work together safely. The bar is low on purpose. The League wants everyone to have a chance.

### The Process

1. **Registration** — Fill out your trainer card application at any League office. You'll provide your name, region of origin, and current monster roster. This is public information.
2. **Assessment** — A League official (usually a gym trainer or aide) will run you through a short practical evaluation. Can your monster follow basic commands? Can you recall it safely? Do you understand type matchups at a fundamental level? That's it.
3. **Induction** — Once approved, you receive your official trainer card, your badge case (empty, for now), and access to League facilities. If you've earned your first rank, you'll also receive your League jacket.

There is no entrance fee. The League believes that talent shouldn't be locked behind a paywall.

### What You Get

- Access to League training grounds, healing stations, and battle arenas across the archipelago.
- Eligibility for ranked matches, gym challenges, tournaments, and contests.
- A public trainer profile tracked on the League's ranking boards.
- Mentorship opportunities with gym trainers and badge holders.
- The right to wear League insignia and represent the faction.

## Leaving

### Voluntary Departure

You can leave the League at any time by submitting a withdrawal form at any League office. Your badges and ribbons remain yours — you earned them. Your rank is frozen, not erased. If you return, you'll pick up where you left off, though you may need to prove you haven't gone rusty.

The League doesn't hold grudges against people who leave on good terms. Life changes. Priorities shift. They get it.

### Involuntary Removal

The League will revoke membership for:

- **Monster abuse or neglect.** Zero tolerance. No warnings. No appeals.
- **Match fixing or cheating.** The integrity of competition is sacred. Get caught rigging a match and you're done.
- **Criminal activity conducted under League insignia.** The League's reputation is everyone's responsibility.
- **Conduct unbecoming.** A catch-all for behavior that damages the League's standing. This is used sparingly and requires Council approval.

Expelled members lose their rank, their access to League facilities, and their right to wear League insignia. Badges and ribbons earned before expulsion are *not* confiscated — the League acknowledges what you did, even if they no longer want you.

### Returning After Leaving

Former members in good standing can rejoin by repeating the registration process. No assessment is required if you left voluntarily and your previous record is clean. Your old rank is restored after your first sanctioned match back.

Former members who were expelled may petition the League Council for reinstatement. This is rare, difficult, and requires demonstrating genuine change. The Council votes, and the decision is final.

## Notes

- Membership in the League does not prevent you from associating with other factions, but you are expected to uphold League values at all times while wearing the insignia.
- Dual faction membership is not officially recognized but is not explicitly forbidden. The League cares about what you do, not who else you talk to.
