# Uniforms

> You can always spot League. They wear it like they mean it.

## Overview

The League doesn't enforce a strict uniform for all members — this isn't the military. But there is a strong visual identity, and members are encouraged to wear it proudly. League colors, insignia, and dress codes vary by role, but the throughline is always the same: clean, sharp, and unmistakably *official*.

## League Colors

The League's primary colors are **deep navy blue** and **gold**. Secondary accents in **white** and **silver** appear on formal wear and ceremonial pieces. These colors are present on everything from trainer jackets to gym signage to tournament banners.

## General Members

Ranked trainers and coordinators receive a **League jacket** upon earning their first rank — a fitted, navy blue jacket with gold piping along the shoulders and the League crest embroidered on the left breast. It's not required wear, but most members put it on for tournaments and official events. Many personalize theirs with patches from gyms they've challenged or tournaments they've entered.

Beyond the jacket, League trainers tend toward practical, athletic clothing. The expectation is that you could step onto a battlefield at any moment and be ready.

## Gym Leaders

Gym leaders have more freedom in their personal style but are expected to incorporate League colors into their look. Most design a signature outfit that reflects both their type specialty and the League's identity. The one non-negotiable piece is the **Leader's Sash** — a navy and gold sash worn diagonally across the chest during official gym battles and League ceremonies.

## Elite Four

The Elite Four are welcome to wear whatever they want, though there's an expectation to look imposing and authoritative. They are the League's public face in times of crisis, and they dress the part.

## Champion

The Champion's attire is entirely their own. But they often look stellar and rather grandious.

## Contest Coordinators

Contest participants follow a looser dress code. The League provides a **Coordinator's Pin** — a small gold and silver brooch shaped like a star — that identifies them as League-affiliated performers. Beyond that, coordinators are encouraged to dress expressively. Contests are about showmanship, and the League respects that.

## Notes

- League insignia are not to be worn by non-members. This is taken seriously.
- Personalization is welcomed but defacing League colors or the crest is considered disrespectful.
- Retired members may continue wearing their jacket or insignia. Once League, always League — if you earned it.
