# Allies and Enemies

# Overview

The Spirit Keepers judge relationships by one measure: does this faction respect the balance? Those who honor the natural and spiritual order of the world are welcome at Keeper fires. Those who exploit it, pervert it, or treat it as raw material for ambition will find the Keepers standing in their path — quietly, firmly, and with the full weight of ancient tradition behind them.

# Allies

## Rangers

Rangers and Keepers share the wilds. Rangers protect the physical ecosystem; Keepers protect the spiritual one. Their patrols overlap, their concerns align, and their methods complement each other. When a Ranger encounters something they can't explain — a haunted grove, a restless spirit, a monster behaving in impossible ways — a Keeper is the first person they call.

## Twilight Order

A relationship that surprises outsiders. The Order and the Keepers share a reverence for the metaphysical, a respect for ritual, and a belief that the world holds more than what the eye can see. Where they differ — the Order's ambition versus the Keepers' restraint — they disagree as siblings rather than strangers. Keepers monitor the Order's more aggressive tendencies, but the bond of shared spiritual understanding runs deep.

## The Tribes

The oldest alliance on the islands. Keepers and Tribes have walked the same spiritual paths for generations, honoring the same sacred places and sharing knowledge that predates written history. Tribal elders and Keeper mystics speak a common language of reverence and responsibility. When either group is threatened, the other responds without being asked.

## Ranchers

Ranchers treat the land and its creatures with the kind of respect the Keepers wish everyone showed. Their approach is practical where the Keepers' is spiritual, but the result is the same — healthy land, healthy monsters, and a community that takes stewardship seriously. Keepers are always welcome on ranch land, and Ranchers trust Keepers when strange things start happening to their herds.

## Tamers

Tamers' genuine love for all lifeforms — digital or otherwise — resonates with Keeper values. Their protective instincts, their willingness to befriend rather than control, and their respect for things they don't fully understand make them natural allies. Keepers see in Tamers a modern echo of their own philosophy: that the world's creatures deserve partnership, not subjugation.

# Enemies

## Project Obsidian

The greatest threat the Keepers see in the modern world. Obsidian treats living creatures as components, spiritual sites as resource deposits, and the natural order as an obstacle to overcome. Everything the Keepers exist to protect, Obsidian exists to exploit. Keepers have physically intervened to stop Obsidian operations near sacred sites, and they will do so again. This is not a rivalry — it is a war of principle.

# Neutral

## Digital Dawn

Dawn's obsession with digital supremacy and their dismissal of non-digital life as inferior strikes the Keepers as spiritually bankrupt. The natural world is not hardware to be upgraded. Monsters are not software to be optimized. When Dawn's investigations push into areas of spiritual significance, the Keepers push back — and Dawn has learned that spiritual resistance is harder to hack through than they expected.

## League

The League governs the cities. The Keepers tend the spaces between. There's no overlap and no conflict, just a polite distance maintained by mutual disinterest. The League finds the Keepers strange but harmless. The Keepers find the League loud but tolerable. When they cross paths, it's cordial. When they don't, neither notices.

## Nyakuza

Pirates don't disturb sacred sites, and the Keepers don't interfere with maritime commerce. It's an arrangement built on geographical and philosophical distance. The Keepers find the Nyakuza's superstitions about spirits faintly amusing, and the Nyakuza find the Keepers' powers faintly terrifying. Both sides are content to leave it at that.

## Professor Koa's Lab

The Lab would love to study the Keepers' practices with scientific rigor. The Keepers are not interested in being studied. Occasionally, a Keeper will share a piece of knowledge with a Lab researcher — on their own terms, in their own time. The Lab has learned to accept this. The relationship is respectful but distant, defined by the Keepers' unwillingness to be anyone's research subject.
