# Locations

> Sacred sites are not addresses. They are responsibilities.

## Overview

The Spirit Keepers don't have headquarters or offices. They have Enclaves — small communities of Keepers gathered around sacred sites. Enclaves are rarely marked on maps, not because they're hidden, but because the Keepers see no reason to advertise.

## Known Enclaves

### The Veil — Mictlan Hollows
The largest and most active Enclave, centered near Xochitonal Village. The boundary between the physical and spiritual worlds runs thin here, and the Keepers maintain a constant vigil. Most Initiates receive their early training at the Veil.

### The Deeproot — Anansi Woods
A small Enclave within the ancient forest near the Great Story Tree. The Keepers here focus on nature spirits and the old stories woven into the woods themselves.

### The Vapors — Oracle's Sanctum
A handful of Keepers maintain a presence near the Sacred Vapors. The relationship between the Keepers and the Sanctum's psychic practitioners is complicated — mutual respect, mutual suspicion, and the shared sense that they're studying the same thing from different angles.

### The Hearthstone Circle — Hearthfall Commons
A modest Enclave near Hearthstone Temple. The most accessible Enclave for outsiders seeking the Keepers' help — which is why it exists. Someone has to answer the door when the skeptics come knocking at midnight with a ghost problem.

### The Stillwater — Crowsfoot Marsh
A secretive Enclave deep in the marsh. The Keepers here monitor spiritual contamination in the toxic ecosystem and perform rites that nobody else wants to think about.

## Scattered Keepers

Beyond the Enclaves, individual Keepers and pairs are scattered across the island, tending to smaller sites — a sacred spring here, an ancient tree there, a cave where the wind sounds like voices. These solitary Keepers check in with the nearest Enclave periodically but otherwise work alone.

## Notes

- The Spirit Keepers almost certainly maintain presences on the Conoocoo Archipelago and possibly the Sky Isles, though they do not discuss these with outsiders. The sacred sites there predate everything.
- Enclaves are not fortified or guarded in any conventional sense. The Keepers trust the spirits to handle uninvited guests. The spirits, historically, have not disappointed.
