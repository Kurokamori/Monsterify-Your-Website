# Meeting the Faction

> A spirit in peace is a blessing. A spirit in turmoil is a tragedy.

## Overview

Long before anyone thought to build cities or establish leagues, there where those who believed themselves in tune with the 'spirits' of the world. 

Before even the Great Change these people communed with spirits and atempted to maintain a balance between worlds they could not prove existed. 

Because of this, these people do not believe in the Great Change, the way others who remember the before do. They believe that the Great Change was not a change at all, but rather a revelation. A revelation that the world was never as it seemed. They believe that all which has appeared was always there, and it's simply now visible to those who did not believe.

The Spirit Keepers are a secretive lot. Often believed quacks or insane, they mostly keep to themselves. They dwell in their own corners of the region, only ever visited when someone needs their help. And boy do people need their help.

Despite the vast majority of the island scoffing at the ancient arts of the Spirit Keepers, it appears that they do not persist such opinions the very moment they themselves need to call upon a Keeper.

## Values and Beliefs

- The balance of the worlds is the most important thing.

- The Great Change was not a change, but merely a continuation of what was already the case.

- There is a world beyond our own — a world of spirits — and it is our duty to maintain the balance between the two.

- Spiritual power is as real as is dangerous, and those who try to weild and control it doom themselves to destruction.

## Overall Goal(s)

- Protect sacred sites from those who wish to prevert their power.

- Mediate conflicts between spirits and monsters/people.

- Maintain the balance between the physical and spiritual worlds.

- Preserve history and tradition and ensure it is not lost in the boom of the technological age.

- Monitor and counter Twilight Order activity and any others that seek to disrupt the balance of the worlds.
