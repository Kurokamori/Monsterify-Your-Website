# Spirit Keepers

Ancient spiritual practitioners who predate the Great Change. They believe the Change was not a change at all, but a revelation of what always existed. Dedicated to maintaining the balance between the physical and spiritual worlds, they protect sacred sites, mediate conflicts between spirits and people, and preserve traditions that others have long forgotten.
