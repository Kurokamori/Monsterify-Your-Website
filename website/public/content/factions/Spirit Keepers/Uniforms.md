# Uniforms

> We dress for the spirits, not for you.

## Overview

The Spirit Keepers don't have uniforms in the conventional sense. What they have are traditions — layers of fabric, symbol, and meaning accumulated over generations. A Keeper's attire reflects their personal spiritual practice, their Enclave's traditions, and the sacred sites they tend. No two Keepers look quite the same.

## The Aesthetic

Natural, layered, and deliberately archaic. Keepers favor handmade garments from natural materials — woven cloth, leather, fur, plant fiber, and bone. Colors are muted and earthy: **deep indigo, ochre, moss green, ash grey, and undyed cream**. Bright colors are rare and usually carry specific ritual significance.

Keepers tend to wear flowing layers — robes, wraps, shawls, and cloaks — that move with the body and obscure its shape. The effect is intentional. A Keeper should look like they belong to the landscape, not to a faction.

## The Spirit Mark

Every Keeper's most important identifier isn't worn — it's *on* them. The spirit mark, a tattoo or brand received upon completing their apprenticeship, is placed on a location chosen by their mentor. Some are visible (hands, neck, face). Others are hidden. The mark's design varies by Enclave and mentor, but all are abstract, flowing forms that suggest movement between worlds.

## Ritual Attire

For ceremonies and rites, Keepers don specific garments tied to the occasion — masks, painted body markings, headdresses, or garments made from materials gathered at sacred sites. Ritual attire is never worn casually. It is put on with intention and removed with care.

## Regional Variation

Enclave traditions shape attire significantly. Keepers near coastal sites favor shell and driftwood ornamentation. Mountain Keepers use heavier furs and stone jewelry. Those tending forest shrines often weave living plants into their garments.

## Notes

- There is no rank-based dress distinction. An Elder and an Initiate may dress identically — or completely differently. The spirits don't care about insignia.
- Keepers who interact with the outside world sometimes adopt more conventional clothing to avoid drawing attention. They keep the spirit mark covered in these situations. Not out of shame — out of privacy.
- Offering a Keeper clothing as a gift is considered a gesture of deep respect. Offering them a uniform would be an insult.
