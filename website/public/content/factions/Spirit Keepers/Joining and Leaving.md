# Joining and Leaving

> The spirits do not call everyone. But when they call, it is unwise to refuse.

## Joining

### Requirements

- You must possess some degree of spiritual sensitivity. This cannot be taught — only awakened in those who already carry it.
- You must be willing to devote yourself to a practice that most of the world considers superstition. The Keepers have no interest in half-hearted believers.
- You must be introduced by an existing Keeper or arrive at a sacred site during a time when the Keepers are willing to receive visitors. Both are rare.

### The Process

There are two paths into the Spirit Keepers, and neither is entirely within your control:

#### The Calling

The most traditional path. A person begins experiencing spiritual phenomena — visions, unexplained connections with ghost or psychic-type monsters, dreams of places they've never been. When this happens, a Keeper will often appear, seemingly of their own accord, and offer guidance. Those who accept are taken to a sacred site to begin their training.

The Keepers insist they don't seek these people out. They say the spirits point the way.

#### The Seeker

Less common but not unheard of. A person actively seeks out the Spirit Keepers — usually after an encounter with something they can't explain. Finding them is the first test. The Keepers do not advertise their locations, and most who go looking give up long before they arrive.

Those who do find a Keeper enclave are assessed through conversation and observation. There is no written test. The Keepers will simply spend time with you — sometimes days, sometimes weeks — before deciding whether to accept you. If they don't, they'll send you away with kindness but no explanation.

#### For Both Paths

Once accepted, you enter a period of apprenticeship under a senior Keeper. You'll learn the rites, the sacred sites, the old stories, and — most importantly — how to listen. The apprenticeship has no fixed length. It ends when your mentor says it ends.

Upon completion, you receive a spirit mark — a small tattoo or brand placed at a location on the body chosen by your mentor, symbolizing your bond with the spiritual world.

### What You Get

- Training in spiritual practices that predate every other faction on the islands.
- Access to sacred sites and the knowledge of what they contain.
- The ability to mediate between the physical and spiritual worlds — a skill that is in higher demand than anyone publicly admits.
- A community of people who understand what it's like to see what others cannot.

## Leaving

### Voluntary Departure

The Keepers will not stop you from leaving, but they will mourn it. Spiritual sensitivity doesn't go away because you remove yourself from the practice, and the Keepers believe that an untrained sensitive is a danger to themselves and the balance.

If you leave, your spirit mark remains — it cannot be undone. You are asked to refrain from performing rites or visiting sacred sites without accompaniment. Most former Keepers honor this. The ones who don't tend to learn why the rule exists.

### Involuntary Removal

The Spirit Keepers rarely expel anyone, but it does happen:

- **Desecrating a sacred site.** Whether through carelessness or intent, damaging a site of spiritual significance is unforgivable. The spirits themselves tend to handle the immediate consequences. The Keepers handle the rest.
- **Exploiting spiritual power for personal gain.** The Keepers draw a hard line between using spiritual knowledge to help others and using it to manipulate them. Fortune-telling for coin is frowned upon. Cursing someone for payment will end your time with the Keepers permanently.
- **Collaborating with the Twilight Order.** The Order seeks to harness and weaponize what the Keepers protect. Aiding them in any capacity is considered the deepest betrayal.

Expelled Keepers are subjected to a severing rite — a ritual that doesn't remove spiritual sensitivity but does cut the person's connection to the Keeper network and the sacred sites they were entrusted with. It is described by those who've experienced it as profoundly unpleasant.

### Returning After Leaving

Former Keepers who left peacefully may return by seeking out their old mentor or any senior Keeper. You will need to undergo a period of reacquaintance — shorter than the original apprenticeship, but not trivial. The spirits are patient, but they do take note of absence.

Former Keepers who were severed cannot return. The rite is permanent. The Keepers do not discuss this further.
