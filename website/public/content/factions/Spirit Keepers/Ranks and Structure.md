# Ranks and Structure

> We do not climb. We deepen.

## Overview

The Spirit Keepers don't think in terms of rank. They think in terms of depth — how deep your connection to the spiritual world runs, how much you've been entrusted with, and how long you've walked the path. There are no promotions, no titles to chase. You simply grow, and the role you hold reflects that growth.

## Roles

### Initiate
A newly accepted apprentice under the guidance of a senior Keeper. Initiates learn the foundational rites, the history of the sacred sites, and — most importantly — how to be still long enough to listen. The apprenticeship has no fixed length. Some Initiates are ready in months. Others take years.

### Keeper
A fully trained Spirit Keeper who has completed their apprenticeship and received their spirit mark. Keepers maintain sacred sites, perform rites, mediate between spirits and people, and respond to spiritual disturbances. Most Keepers are solitary or work in pairs, spread across remote locations throughout the archipelago.

### Watcher
A Keeper entrusted with monitoring a specific region or phenomenon over the long term. Watchers are assigned to areas of heightened spiritual activity — convergence points, dormant sites, or locations where the boundary between worlds runs thin. They report changes to the Elders but otherwise act on their own judgment.

### Elder
The most experienced Keepers, recognized for their deep connection to the spiritual world and their wisdom in navigating it. Elders guide Initiates, make decisions about the protection of sacred sites, and serve as the Keepers' collective memory. There is no set number of Elders — the title is acknowledged by consensus among existing Elders.

### The Speaker
A single Elder chosen to represent the Spirit Keepers to the outside world. The Speaker serves as the faction's Envoy to the regional leadership council and handles all formal dealings with other factions. Most Speakers dislike the role intensely — it requires engaging with politics, bureaucracy, and people who think "spiritual balance" is a metaphor.

## Enclaves

Spirit Keepers are organized into loose Enclaves — small communities centered around a sacred site or region. An Enclave might be as few as two or three Keepers maintaining a shrine, or as many as a dozen gathered around a major convergence point.

Enclaves operate independently. There is no central authority dictating what an Enclave should prioritize — the spirits and the land make that clear enough.

## Notes

- The Spirit Keepers have no formal governance. Elders consult with each other when major decisions arise, but there is no council, no votes, no hierarchy of Elders. Consensus is reached through discussion and, when necessary, divination.
- Keepers do not compete for advancement. A Keeper who tries to "rank up" has fundamentally misunderstood the practice.
- The faction's decentralized nature makes them nearly impossible to disrupt — but also nearly impossible to unite quickly when a threat demands it.
