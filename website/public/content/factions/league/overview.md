# League

The oldest and most visible power structure in the archipelago. Built on gyms, tournaments, and ranked competition, the League believes battle is the most honest language in the world. They serve as the closest thing the islands have to a legitimate government, cultivating the strongest trainers through exhibitions, gym battles, tournaments, and contests.
