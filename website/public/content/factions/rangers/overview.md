# Rangers

Intermediaries between nature, monster, and man. Rangers go where the map runs out — the Outerwilds, the Far Reaches, the places other factions consider too remote to matter. They see themselves as part of the world, not above it, and dedicate themselves to maintaining ecological balance with selfless determination.
