# Allies and Enemies

# Overview

Rangers judge every faction by one standard: what are you doing to the land, the monsters, and the people who depend on both? Help protect them, and you'll have a Ranger's trust. Exploit them, and you'll have a Ranger in your way. It's not complicated, and Rangers don't pretend it is.

# Allies

## League

The League funds Ranger operations, protects Ranger authority, and treats conservation as a legitimate arm of governance. In return, Rangers provide intelligence from the wilds, attend League events as honored guests, and lend their credibility to League policy. The relationship is old and comfortable — though Rangers will never admit to being a branch of the League, and the League will never stop implying that they are.

## Ranchers

Rangers and Ranchers share the same dirt. Their values overlap almost completely — care for the land, respect for monsters, commitment to community. Ranger outposts near ranches are always stocked, always welcome, and always treated like family. The bond between these two factions isn't political. It's personal.

## Spirit Keepers

Keepers protect the spiritual ecosystem. Rangers protect the physical one. When a Ranger finds something in the wilds that defies explanation — a haunted grove, a restless presence, a monster acting against its nature — a Keeper is the first call they make. The relationship is one of deep mutual respect, built on the shared understanding that the world has layers most people never see.

## The Tribes

The Tribes earned Ranger respect by being the original stewards of the land. Rangers honor tribal boundaries, defer to tribal knowledge on local ecosystems, and have never once tried to extend their authority into tribal territory. In return, the Tribes tolerate Ranger patrols near their borders and occasionally share observations that save Ranger lives.

## Tamers

Tamers care about monsters in a way Rangers find genuinely admirable. They don't catch and battle — they befriend and protect. Rangers and Tamers cooperate on wildlife rescue operations, share field observations, and generally get along the way good-hearted people tend to. Tamers are welcome at Ranger stations, and Rangers are welcome at Tamer gatherings.

# Enemies

## Project Obsidian

The single biggest threat to monster welfare on the islands. Obsidian's experiments, their covert collection operations, and their treatment of living creatures as laboratory components represent everything Rangers exist to prevent. Rangers have shut down Obsidian field operations, confiscated specimens, and pushed publicly for investigations. Obsidian considers this interference. Rangers consider it their job.

# Neutral

## Digital Dawn

Dawn's dismissal of non-digital life as inferior and their willingness to conduct unregulated experiments in the field puts them squarely in Ranger crosshairs. Rangers have intercepted Dawn operations in ecologically sensitive areas multiple times and will continue to do so. Dawn's technology makes them slippery, but Rangers are patient.

## Nyakuza

Smuggling routes run through the wilds. Rangers patrol the wilds. Conflict is inevitable. The Nyakuza use forest trails, hidden coves, and remote passages to move goods the League would rather they didn't, and Rangers catch them at it regularly. There's no personal hatred — Rangers even grudgingly respect Nyakuza survival skills — but duty is duty.

## Professor Koa's Lab

The Lab and the Rangers should be closer than they are. They share a love of the natural world, but their approaches rarely sync up. The Lab wants data collection and long-term studies. Rangers want action and immediate protection. The respect is real. The collaboration is occasional.

## Twilight Order

The Order doesn't bother the wilds, and the wilds don't bother the Order. Rangers have investigated Order activities a few times when local communities raised concerns, and each time found nothing actionable. Neither side loses sleep over the other.
