# Meeting the Faction

> We don't catch them. We protect them. We earn them.

## Overview

Rangers go where the map runs out. The Outerwilds, the Far Reaches, the places other factions consider too remote to matter — that's their territory, and they know every corner of it.

Rangers are the intermediaries between nature, monster, and man. Between petty jobs like finding missing monsters to saving the forests from a rampant fire type outbreak, Rangers are the ones who keep the peace.

Rangers see themselves as part of the world, of nature, not above it. Though they may not specifically consider themselves "equal" to monsters, they feel they are one with them - not a higher being destined to control them.

Above all else, it is their job to maintain nature and peace - to protect the delecate balance of the ecosystem of the islands.

Rangers are a varied lot, with many outposts throughout the entire region, you're likely to find Rangers of some sort protecting your home, no matter where you are. But this variance leads to some innate difference as well. It has been observed by some, that the Rangers of high and hot Agni Peaks are far more quick tempered than those for example of the damp and cold Jotun Tundra.

But no matter their differences, Rangers are some of the most selfless and dedicated people on the islands.
