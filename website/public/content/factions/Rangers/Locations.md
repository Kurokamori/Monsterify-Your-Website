> If there's wild land, there's a Ranger post on it.

## Overview

The Rangers maintain the most extensive network of outposts on Conoco Island. Every region has at least one staffed outpost, and many have two or more — one near the regional city and additional posts deeper in the wilds. Rangers do not operate on the Sky Isles or the Conoocoo Archipelago; those territories are managed by their own peoples.

## Ranger Command

### The Greenhold — Heimdal City, Hearthfall Commons
The Rangers' central command and the High Warden's seat. A sturdy, no-nonsense compound on the outskirts of Heimdal City that houses administration, the regional Warden council chamber, training facilities for incoming Cadets, and the Rangers' cartography archive — the most accurate collection of maps on the island.

## Regional Outposts

### Hearthfall Commons
- **Greenhold Station** — Heimdal City. Doubles as Cadet training grounds and the administrative hub.
- **Bonfire Watch** — Bonfire Town. A small patrol post covering the commons' eastern edge.

### Agni Peaks
- **Pyre Station** — Agni City. The Firefighting Division's primary base. Coordinates volcanic hazard response across the range.
- **Tapas Ridge Post** — Tapas Town. A high-altitude monitoring post staffed by Conservation and Firefighting Rangers.

### Poseidon's Reach
- **Tide Station** — Nereid Harbor. Coastal patrol headquarters. Manages marine conservation and coordinates with local fishing communities.
- **Maelstrom Watch** — Maelstrom Point. A remote outpost monitoring the dangerous currents and the creatures that thrive in them.

### Thunderbird Heights
- **Stormwatch Post** — Storm Dance Village. A weather monitoring and emergency response station. Rangers here work closely with electric-type monsters.

### Demeter's Grove
- **Grove Station** — Eleusis City. Conservation-focused outpost managing the forest ecosystem and agricultural boundary disputes.
- **Wheat Watch** — Golden Wheat. A seasonal post active during harvest and migration periods.

### Jötun Tundra
- **Frosthold** — Utgard City. The tundra's primary outpost. Rangers here are some of the toughest in the faction — the cold demands it.
- **Glacier Post** — Eternal Glacier. A remote, spartan station at the edge of mapped territory. Staffed by Cartography and Conservation Rangers.

### Kshatriya Arena
- **Arena Station** — Kurukshetra City. Manages the balance between the region's martial culture and its wild monster populations. Combat Division has a strong presence here.

### Crowsfoot Marsh
- **Bogwatch** — Bog Town. A specialist outpost focused on toxic ecosystem management. Healing Division Rangers are in high demand here.

### Terra Madre Basin
- **Basin Station** — Tellus City. Oversees the vast open territory of the basin. Conservation and Cartography Rangers cover enormous patrol areas.

### Quetzal Winds
- **Windreach Post** — Wind Village. A clifftop station monitoring aerial migration routes and nesting grounds.

### Oracle's Sanctum
- **Sanctum Watch** — Pythia Village. A quiet post. The psychic-heavy region is unusually peaceful, and the Rangers here spend more time researching than patrolling.

### Anansi Woods
- **Webwatch** — Story Village. Deep forest outpost. Rangers here specialize in navigating the dense, silk-threaded canopy and managing the region's bug-type populations.

### Stoneheart Cliffs
- **Cliffwatch** — Cairn Town. High-altitude patrol covering the cliff trails and ancient stone sites. Works closely with local druids.

### Mictlan Hollows
- **Hollows Station** — Xochitonal Village. One of the more unsettling postings. Rangers here deal with ghost-type activity and maintain the boundary between the living and the restless.

### Long Valley
- **Dragon Gate Post** — Jade Village. A prestigious but dangerous posting. Rangers here monitor dragon-type populations and ensure the valley's powerful inhabitants don't wander into settled areas.

### Raven's Shadow
- **Shadowline Post** — Shadow Village. Rangers here operate in near-permanent twilight. Patrols are paired, never solo. The dark-type residents test your nerves.

### Hephaestus Forge
- **Forge Watch** — Forge Town. Manages the balance between industrial activity and the surrounding ecosystem. Environmental monitoring is the primary focus.

### Seelie Courts
- **Glamour Post** — Oberon Village. The strangest posting in the Rangers. Fairy-type territory plays by its own rules, and the Rangers stationed here have learned to be very flexible.

### Pirates Bay
- **Tideline Station** — On the border of Pirates Bay, not within it. The Rangers monitor the boundary but don't patrol Nyakuza territory. An uneasy arrangement that both sides prefer to fighting about.

## Notes

- Outpost staffing varies by season and threat level. Some posts run with as few as three Rangers; others swell to a dozen during crisis periods.
- Rangers are expected to know their region intimately. Transfers between regions happen but require adjustment time — the land is different everywhere.
- The Rangers' absence from the Sky Isles and Conoocoo Archipelago is deliberate. Those lands have their own guardians, and the Rangers respect that boundary.
