# Ranks and Structure

> The chain of command exists so the chain of protection never breaks.

## Overview

The Rangers are the most structured of the non-governmental factions — and they have to be. When a wildfire tears through Agni Peaks or a territorial monster threatens a settlement, "figure it out" isn't good enough. The Rangers run on clear roles, defined territories, and a command structure built for rapid response.

## Ranks

### Cadet
A trainee on their probationary patrol, paired with a senior Ranger. Cadets learn the land, the protocols, and whether this life is actually for them.

### Ranger
A full member with an assigned patrol territory and outpost. The backbone of the faction. Most Rangers spend their entire career here and are proud to.

### Senior Ranger
An experienced Ranger entrusted with mentoring Cadets, coordinating between patrols, and making field decisions when the Warden isn't available. Promotion is based on experience and temperament, not combat ability.

### Warden
The commander of a regional outpost. Wardens manage all Ranger operations within their region — patrol assignments, resource allocation, crisis response, and coordination with local governance. Each region of the archipelago has one Warden.

### High Warden
The leader of the Rangers as a whole. The High Warden sets faction-wide policy, coordinates between regions, and serves as the Rangers' voice in matters that affect the entire archipelago. Appointed by a council of Wardens when the previous High Warden steps down or is removed.

### The Envoy
The Rangers' representative to the regional leadership council. Typically the High Warden themselves or a Senior Ranger appointed by them. The Envoy advocates for ecological policy, protected land designations, and monster welfare legislation.

## Divisions

Every Ranger is assigned to a Division based on their skills and the needs of their region. Rangers may transfer between Divisions over time as their abilities develop.

### Conservation
The largest division. Conservation Rangers manage monster populations, protect endangered species, maintain migration corridors, and monitor habitat health. The quiet, essential work that keeps the islands alive.

### Combat
Threat response. Combat Rangers handle dangerous monster encounters, territorial disputes that have turned violent, and provide security during crises. They're trained to resolve situations with minimal harm — to people *and* monsters.

### Healing
Field medics for both monsters and people. Healing Rangers operate from outposts and in the field, treating injuries, managing disease outbreaks, and running rehabilitation programs for injured wild monsters.

### Cartography
Explorers and mapmakers. Cartography Rangers push into unmapped territory, document new areas, track geological and ecological changes, and maintain the most accurate maps of the archipelago in existence. They tend to be the most solitary Rangers — and the most interesting at parties.

### Firefighting
Specialists in wildfire response, volcanic hazard management, and disaster relief. Particularly critical in regions like Agni Peaks. Firefighting Rangers train with fire-type and water-type monsters and are often the first responders to natural disasters of any kind.

## Troops

Rangers are organized into Troops — small, semi-permanent teams assigned to a specific patrol area within a region. A Troop typically consists of three to six Rangers, often from mixed Divisions, led by a Senior Ranger.

Each Troop is responsible for its patch of territory. They know every trail, every den, every seasonal pattern within their area. Troops develop their own culture over time — the Rangers of the frozen tundra operate differently from those patrolling tropical coastline, and both would struggle in the other's territory.

Troops are named after their patrol area and are a Ranger's primary identity within the faction. Ask a Ranger who they are and they'll give you their Troop before their rank.

## Notes

- Division assignments are not rigid. A Conservation Ranger who discovers a talent for field medicine can transfer to Healing. The Rangers value adaptability.
- Wardens have significant autonomy within their region. A Warden in Jotun Tundra and a Warden in Agni Peaks may run their operations very differently, and the High Warden allows this — the land dictates the approach.
- Despite the structure, Rangers are not military. Orders can be questioned. Wardens explain their reasoning. The hierarchy exists to serve the mission, not the other way around.
