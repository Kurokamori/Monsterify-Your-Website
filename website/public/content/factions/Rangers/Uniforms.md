# Uniforms

> If you can see a Ranger coming, they want you to.

## Overview

Rangers have the most functional uniform of any faction — practical, recognizable, and adapted to whatever biome they operate in. The core elements stay consistent so that a Ranger is identifiable anywhere on the archipelago, but the details change with the terrain.

## Ranger Colors

**Forest green**, **muted red** and **earth brown**, with **orange/gold** accents. These are the standard, but Rangers in specialized environments adapt: white and grey in the tundra, muted red and charcoal near volcanic regions, sandy khaki along the coasts.

## The Standard Kit

Every Ranger receives the following upon completing their probationary patrol:

- **Field Jacket** — A durable, weather-appropriate jacket in Ranger colors. Cut for mobility, with reinforced shoulders and plenty of pockets. Rangers in warmer climates often swap this for a vest.
- **Utility Belt** — Standard-issue belt carrying essential tools: first aid supplies, a multi-tool, a signal whistle, and clips for monster containers.

Beyond these, Rangers dress for their environment. Boots are universal. Everything else depends on where you're posted.

## Division Markers

Each Division has a small insignia worn on the jacket shoulder:

- **Conservation** — A leaf.
- **Combat** — Crossed claws.
- **Healing** — A feather.
- **Cartography** — A compass rose.
- **Firefighting** — A flame within a circle.

## Rank Indicators

Rank is shown through simple additions to the jacket:

- **Cadets** wear a plain jacket with no insignia.
- **Rangers** add their Division and Troop patches.
- **Senior Rangers** add a bronze clasp to the jacket.
- **Wardens** wear a silver clasp and a more ornate jacket.
- **The High Warden** wears a gold clasp.

## Notes

- Rangers are expected to maintain their gear but are free to modify and personalize it as long as the core elements remain recognizable. Many veterans' kits look nothing like what they were issued — patched, reinforced, and adapted over years in the field.
- Off-duty Rangers often still wear their jacket. Old habits.
- Troop identity runs deep. Many Troops develop their own informal additions — a specific knot style, a feather in the hat, a particular way of wearing the jacket. These aren't official, but they matter.
