# Joining and Leaving

> The wilds don't care about your resume. Neither do we.

## Joining

### Requirements

- You must have at least one bonded monster capable of surviving in the field. Not battling — surviving. There's a difference.
- You must be physically and mentally prepared for extended time in remote, often dangerous terrain.
- You must be willing to put the needs of the ecosystem above your own comfort. This is non-negotiable.

### The Process

1. **Find an Outpost** — Ranger outposts are scattered across every region of the archipelago, from the volcanic ridges of Agni Peaks to the frozen stretches of Jotun Tundra. Walk into any one of them and tell them you want to join. They'll take you seriously.
2. **The Trail** — You'll be paired with a senior Ranger for a probationary patrol. This lasts anywhere from a few weeks to a few months depending on the region and the season. You'll learn the land, the local monster populations, and what it actually means to keep the balance. Many wash out here — not from lack of skill, but from lack of patience.
3. **The Post** — Once your mentor signs off, you're assigned to an outpost. You'll receive your Ranger sash, your patrol territory, and your first real assignment. Welcome to the job.

There is no fee, but there's also no salary for a while. Rangers in training live off the land and the outpost's shared supplies. You eat what the wilds provide.

### What You Get

- A patrol territory and the authority to enforce ecological protections within it.
- Access to Ranger outpost resources — shelter, supplies, medical care, and communication networks across the archipelago.
- The respect of people who know what it means to walk the Outerwilds alone.
- Training in monster behavior, wilderness survival, and ecological management from people who've done it their whole lives.

## Leaving

### Voluntary Departure

Rangers understand that the life isn't for everyone. If you want to leave, you tell your outpost commander and work with them to ensure your patrol territory is covered. This is the one thing the Rangers ask — don't leave a gap in the line.

Once your territory is reassigned, you turn in your sash and walk. No hard feelings. No record follows you. The Rangers know that someone who leaves honestly is worth more than someone who stays resentfully.

### Involuntary Removal

Rangers will remove members for:

- **Poaching or ecological destruction.** The one thing a Ranger cannot be is the problem. Caught hunting protected species, damaging sacred groves, or enabling others to do so? Gone. Immediately.
- **Abandoning your post during a crisis.** If the forest is burning and you walk the other way, the Rangers have no use for you.
- **Exploiting the position.** Using your Ranger authority to intimidate civilians, extort resources, or play politics gets you expelled and reported to whatever local governance exists.

Removed Rangers lose their sash, their territory, and their access to the outpost network. The wilds don't forget, and neither do the Rangers.

### Returning After Leaving

Former Rangers who left in good standing can return by reporting to any outpost. You'll likely need a refresher patrol, especially if you've been gone long enough for the land to have changed — and it always changes — but the process is straightforward.

Former Rangers who were expelled may petition the regional Ranger council. These petitions are taken seriously but decided slowly. The Rangers believe in second chances, but they believe in the ecosystem more.
