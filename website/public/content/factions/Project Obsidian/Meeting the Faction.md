# Meeting the Faction

> Nature has no laws. Only patterns. And patterns can be broken, can be studied, can be manipulated.

## Overview

Progress has always made people uncomfortable, for Project Obsidian, that's a plus.

On paper, Project Obsidian is an extension of the Koa Laboratory, a place of science and learning. They're clean as can be, from their paper work to their white lab coats. But looks can be deceiving.

Project Obsidian is a dark organization, obsessed with altering lifeforms. From fusions to type changes, their goals are simple, they wish to be god. Not play god. Take the control of life from him entirely. From changing the types of newly hatched eggs to altering the species of an alter child, they wish to harnass what makes this world unique, and synthesize it into a vile they can buy, sell, and understand.

There is no cruelty. There are no ethics. There is simply lock-step progression.

## Values and Beliefs

- Nature's laws are obstacles, puzzles perhaps, to be overcome not revered.
- Sentiment is only acceptable in quantites that do not impede upon the creation and distruction of science.
- They believe they are doing a principled good thing, they see it as they are smarter than others, able to understand that sentiment is holding back true progress.

## Overall Goal(s)

- Harness complete control over type change, fusions, alters.
    - Be able to sell 'botique' monsters / babies : allowing them to alter the very DNA of an individual to their trainer's/parent's desire.

- Acquire and study legendary and powerful monsters and harness this distinct power.

- Leverage their research to create the 'perfect monsters' a life form of monster above the "mixed breed half wits" of today, and use it for profit and power.
