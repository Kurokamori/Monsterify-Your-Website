# Project Obsidian

A dark scientific organization obsessed with altering lifeforms. Masquerading as an extension of Koa's Lab, Project Obsidian seeks to harness complete control over type changes, fusions, and alters — not to play god, but to take the control of life from him entirely. There is no cruelty. There are no ethics. There is simply lock-step progression.
