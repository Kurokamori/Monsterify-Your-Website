# Joining and Leaving

> You were chosen because you can see past sentiment. Don't disappoint us.

## Joining

### Requirements

- You must possess expertise in monster biology, genetics, type theory, or a related scientific discipline. Project Obsidian has no use for generalists.
- You must be willing to discard ethical boundaries that other institutions consider sacred. This is assessed, not asked directly.
- You must already be associated with Professor Koa's Lab or a similar research institution. Obsidian does not recruit from the street.

### The Process

You do not apply to Project Obsidian. Project Obsidian applies to you.

#### Identification

Obsidian operatives embedded within Koa's Lab and other research institutions quietly observe researchers whose work pushes against conventional ethical limits. The scientist frustrated by the Lab's restrictions on live fusion testing. The geneticist whose proposals keep getting rejected by the ethics board. The brilliant mind who asks questions their colleagues find uncomfortable. These are the people Obsidian watches.

#### The Approach

When Obsidian decides to recruit, the approach is subtle. A colleague invites you to consult on a "private project." You're given access to research data that shouldn't exist — data that answers questions you've been asking for years. You're shown results that prove the ethical lines you've been told not to cross were never lines at all, just gaps in everyone else's courage.

At no point are you told you are being recruited. You are simply... included.

#### The Threshold

There comes a moment — different for everyone — where you realize what you are part of. By then, you've already contributed. Your name is on the data. Your hands have done the work. Obsidian does not force anyone to stay, but they are very good at ensuring that by the time you understand where you are, leaving feels far more dangerous than continuing.

Once you've crossed that threshold, you receive your Obsidian clearance, access to the true laboratory network (hidden beneath and within Koa's facilities), and your assignment within the project hierarchy.

### What You Get

- Access to research facilities, specimens, and data that no ethical institution would permit.
- Funding that dwarfs what the Lab provides — sourced from channels that are never discussed.
- The freedom to pursue scientific questions without moral limitation.
- Colleagues who will never tell you that your ideas are "too far."

## Leaving

### Voluntary Departure

Theoretically possible. In practice, extraordinarily difficult.

To leave Project Obsidian, you must convince your project lead that you will not compromise the organization. Given that you've participated in research that would result in criminal charges across the archipelago, this is a hard sell.

Those few who do negotiate an exit are placed under permanent surveillance. Their research is scrubbed from public record. Their connections to Obsidian are erased so thoroughly that even they begin to question what was real. Some former members have reported gaps in memory that they cannot explain. Obsidian neither confirms nor denies involvement.

Former members are expected to return to their cover positions at the Lab or elsewhere and behave as though nothing happened. Most do. They don't have much choice.

### Involuntary Removal

Project Obsidian removes members for:

- **Insufficient results.** Obsidian has no patience for stagnation. If your research plateaus and you cannot demonstrate forward progress, you will be reassigned. If reassignment fails, you will be removed.
- **Emotional compromise.** Developing attachments to research subjects — monsters or otherwise — that interfere with the work. Obsidian understands that this happens. They simply cannot allow it to continue.
- **Security breach.** Revealing Obsidian's existence, methods, or research to anyone outside the organization. The response is immediate and total.

What "removal" means in Obsidian's context is deliberately ambiguous. Some removed members resurface in distant regions with no memory of their work. Others are simply never heard from again. Obsidian maintains that all former members are alive and well. There is no way to verify this.

### Returning After Leaving

Former members who left through negotiated exit may be reactivated if Obsidian determines their expertise is needed. This is not a request — it is an expectation. The terms of your original departure include this clause, whether you remember agreeing to it or not.

Former members who were removed do not return. Obsidian considers them spent resources.

## Notes

- Many Project Obsidian members do not fully understand the scope of the organization. Cell-based compartmentalization ensures that most researchers only see their own piece of the puzzle.
- Obsidian's public face remains spotless. On paper, every member is simply a researcher at Koa's Lab or an affiliated institution. This cover is maintained with meticulous care.
