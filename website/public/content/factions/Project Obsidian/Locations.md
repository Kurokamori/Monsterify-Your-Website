# Locations

> On paper, we're in the Lab. Off paper, we're underneath it.

## Overview

Project Obsidian's locations are, officially, nonexistent. Every Obsidian facility is built within, beneath, or adjacent to a legitimate institution — primarily Professor Koa's Lab. The public sees a research campus. Obsidian sees a shell.

## Primary Facility

### Sub-Level Complex — Beneath the Main Laboratory, Heimdal City
The heart of Obsidian's operations, hidden beneath Professor Koa's main campus. Multiple floors of restricted laboratories, specimen containment, and data archives accessible only via the Obsidian Badge. The Sub-Level is rumored to extend significantly deeper than any legitimate university building should, but surface-level surveys show nothing unusual. Obsidian is very good at construction.

## Secondary Sites

Obsidian maintains concealed research spaces within or near several Lab outposts. These are smaller, specialized, and known only to the personnel assigned to them.

- **Forge Annex** — Hephaestus Forge. Materials science and experimental alloy research, disguised as an industrial partnership with local smiths. Houses equipment for physical augmentation testing.
- **Marsh Hollow** — Crowsfoot Marsh. Toxicology and biological modification research. The marsh's isolation and the Lab outpost's small staff make it ideal for work that requires privacy.
- **Caldera Lab** — Volcanic Peaks, Conoocoo Archipelago. Obsidian's most remote facility. Tucked within the Obsidian Halls — the name is a coincidence that delights no one. Focused on high-energy experiments that would be noticed anywhere less volatile.

## Acquisition Points

Obsidian obtains research specimens — monsters, genetic material, and other biological samples — through channels that never lead back to the organization. Acquisition cells operate independently, delivering specimens to dead-drop locations that change with each delivery.

## Notes

- Professor Koa is not aware of the Sub-Level Complex. Or if he is, he has chosen a response that Obsidian cannot distinguish from ignorance.
- Obsidian's facilities are designed to be sealed and abandoned on short notice. Each site has a sterilization protocol that can erase all evidence of its purpose within hours.
- Staff commute to Obsidian facilities through their normal Lab routines. The transition from "legitimate researcher" to "Obsidian Associate" happens behind a door that looks like a supply closet.
