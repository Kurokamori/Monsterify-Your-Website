# Allies and Enemies

# Overview

Project Obsidian has exactly two kinds of relationships: useful and irrelevant. They don't seek friendship, don't value sentiment, and don't waste resources on diplomacy that doesn't serve their research. The factions that work with them do so because the science is too good to ignore. The factions that oppose them do so because the science is too dangerous to allow.

# Allies

## Digital Dawn

Obsidian's most productive partnership. Dawn provides computational infrastructure, digital analysis, and a willingness to push boundaries that matches Obsidian's own. In return, Obsidian shares biological data and experimental results that fuel Dawn's understanding of the intersection between organic and digital life. Neither faction pretends the other is virtuous. They simply recognize that together, they can do things that neither could alone.

## Koa's Laboratory

The Lab is Obsidian's public face — the legitimate institution that makes Obsidian's existence palatable to the rest of the archipelago. On paper, Obsidian is a specialized research division. In practice, the relationship is more complex. The Lab provides cover, funding channels, and access to mainstream research networks. Obsidian provides breakthroughs that the Lab's ethics board would never approve. Both sides know the arrangement is uncomfortable. Neither side is willing to end it.

# Enemies

## Rangers

Rangers have shut down Obsidian field operations, confiscated research specimens, and publicly called for investigations into Obsidian's practices. Obsidian considers Rangers ignorant obstructionists who value sentiment over progress. Rangers consider Obsidian the single greatest threat to monster welfare on the islands. This is not a misunderstanding — it's a fundamental clash of values with no resolution in sight.

## Spirit Keepers

The Keepers see Obsidian's work as a violation of the natural and spiritual order. Obsidian sees the Keepers as superstitious obstacles. Keepers have been known to physically intervene when Obsidian operations approach sacred sites or involve species the Keepers consider spiritually significant. Obsidian has learned to avoid Keeper territory, not out of respect, but because the confrontations are costly and draw unwanted attention.

## The Tribes

Tribal lands are rich with unexplored species and unique biological specimens that Obsidian desperately wants. The Tribes have made it clear — through words, barriers, and occasionally violence — that Obsidian is not welcome. Obsidian has attempted covert collection operations. Some have not ended well. The hostility is deep, mutual, and unlikely to change.

## League

The League considers Obsidian a problem it hasn't found the right solution for yet. Obsidian's secrecy, their refusal to submit to oversight, and persistent rumors about their treatment of monsters have put them firmly on the League's watch list. Obsidian operates carefully around League jurisdiction, avoiding direct confrontation while continuing their work behind closed doors. Neither side has escalated — yet.

## Ranchers

Ranchers have flat-out refused Obsidian access to their herds, their land, and their communities. Obsidian's approach to monsters as raw material for experimentation is everything Ranchers stand against. The hostility is open and personal — Ranchers don't just dislike Obsidian's methods, they find them morally repulsive. Obsidian considers this an emotional reaction to rational science.

## Twilight Order

The Order's mysticism and Obsidian's cold rationalism should make them irrelevant to each other — but the Order's interest in alters, fusions, and spiritual transformation treads uncomfortably close to Obsidian's research territory. Both factions are studying the same phenomena from opposite ends, and neither appreciates the other's approach. The Order sees Obsidian's work as soulless desecration. Obsidian sees the Order's rituals as dressed-up nonsense. The friction is growing.

# Neutral

## Nyakuza

The Nyakuza are useful. They acquire things discreetly, don't ask questions, and don't moralize. Obsidian pays well and on time. It's a transactional relationship with no pretense of warmth — exactly the kind both parties prefer. The Nyakuza don't care what Obsidian does with the specimens they deliver, and Obsidian doesn't care how the Nyakuza acquired them.

## Tamers

Tamers are too gentle and too unfocused to register as either a threat or an asset to Obsidian. Their connection to digital energy is mildly interesting from a research perspective, but Tamers' protective instincts make them uncooperative subjects. Obsidian leaves them alone. Tamers, for their part, find Obsidian unsettling but have never been directly harmed by them.
