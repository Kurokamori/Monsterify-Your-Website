# Uniforms

> You already know what we look like. We look like everyone else at the Lab.

## Overview

Project Obsidian does not have a uniform. Having a uniform would require admitting they exist. Members dress as what they publicly are — researchers, academics, and staff at Professor Koa's Lab or affiliated institutions.

## The Cover

Obsidian members wear standard Lab attire during their public-facing work: lab coats, department-appropriate clothing, safety gear. They are indistinguishable from their legitimate colleagues. This is the entire point.

## In the Hidden Labs

Within Obsidian's true facilities — the ones buried beneath or adjacent to Koa's infrastructure — the dress code shifts to clean, sterile functionality. **White** cleanroom suits, **dark grey** utility wear, and protective equipment rated for the kind of research the Lab's ethics board would never approve. No insignia, no name tags, no identifying marks. Members are referred to by project designation, not name.

The one consistent element is the **Obsidian Badge** — a small, matte black card with no visible markings that grants access to restricted areas. It looks like nothing. It opens everything. Members keep it hidden on their person at all times and are instructed to destroy it if compromised.

## Notes

- There is no visual way to identify an Obsidian member in public. That is by design.
- Members who are seen wearing anything that could link them to Obsidian outside of secured facilities face immediate consequences.
- The sterile aesthetic of the hidden labs is not accidental. Obsidian wants its members to feel like scientists, not criminals. The white coats help.
