# Ranks and Structure

> There is no org chart. There are only levels of clearance — and levels of complicity.

## Overview

Project Obsidian doesn't look like an organization from the outside. It looks like a collection of independent researchers who happen to work at the same institution. That's the point. Obsidian's structure is designed to be invisible — layered beneath and within Professor Koa's Lab like a second skeleton.

## Ranks

### Asset
You're contributing to Obsidian's work without knowing it. Your research, your data, your specimens — they're being used, copied, or redirected by Obsidian operatives embedded in your department. Many Assets never learn what they were part of. The ones who do are offered a choice — or, more accurately, an inevitability.

### Associate
You know. You've crossed the threshold — willingly or otherwise — and you're actively participating in Obsidian research. Associates work on compartmentalized projects, seeing only their piece. You have clearance to the hidden labs but only the sections relevant to your assignment.

### Lead
A senior researcher who manages a specific project or research line. Leads have broader clearance, access to cross-project data, and authority over the Associates assigned to their work. They report directly to a Director.

### Director
The true power within Obsidian. Directors oversee entire research domains — fusion synthesis, type alteration, alter biology, specimen acquisition. Each Director sees a significant portion of the organization's full scope, though even they have blind spots by design.

### The Board
Obsidian's ruling body. The Board sets the organization's strategic objectives, approves high-risk research, and manages the faction's funding and external relationships. Membership is unknown to anyone below Director level. Whether the Board has three members or thirty is itself classified.

## Project Structure

Obsidian organizes its work into Projects — focused research initiatives with specific goals. A project might be as narrow as "synthesize a stable fire/ice type change in amphibian species" or as broad as "map the genetic markers of alter manifestation."

Projects are compartmentalized. An Associate on one project may work in the same hidden lab as an Associate on another and never know what their neighbor is studying. This is standard. Curiosity about other projects is noted — and not in a good way.

## Notes

- Project Obsidian has no Envoy. Officially, they don't exist. Their interests in regional governance are handled through Koa's Lab representatives who may or may not know they're carrying Obsidian's water.
- The line between "Koa's Lab researcher" and "Obsidian Associate" is deliberately blurred. Many members hold legitimate positions at the Lab and perform genuine, ethical research alongside their Obsidian work. The dual identity is both cover and psychological anchor.
- Promotion within Obsidian is not requested. It is assigned when the organization determines you are ready — or when they need you to see more in order to do more.
