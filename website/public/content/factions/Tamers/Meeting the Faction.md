# Meeting the Faction

> There is an undercurrent of digital energy in the world. It is up to us to harness it.

## Overview

Tamers are a unique group, in that they didn't mean to be a faction at all. Originally they where, for the most part, nerdy teens playing on their computers. They would play simple digital pranks, visit sites of dubious quality, and generally cause playful mischief.

Some believe that it happened when the Great Change first started, some believe it was their tomfoolery that cause the change at all. Whatever the case, those with a great attunement to technology where suddenly some of the only ones able to wield the new digital energy that was surging through the world.

For the most part, these sort work alone, or at best, in small teams, but after a period of complete lawlessness, they where finally, if only sort of, organized under the moniker of 'Tamers'.

Today, Tamers are still a varied lot, but they do share a common goal -- to understand and harness the digital energy that is surging through the world.

They work hard to protect all life forms, but especially digital life forms. Furthermore, they too believe there is a digital world. However, they also believe, it's best left alone.

Some Tamers may wish to venture into it, to explore it or understand it. But the focus of the Tamers is to protect and maintain the physical world, not to venture into the digital one.

## Values and Beliefs

- The digital world is a wonderous place, but it is not our place to meddle in it.

- All life, digital or otherwise, is precious and worth protecting.

- Technology is a tool, not a master.

- Monsters are friends, and it's worth enjoying their company. Not just working together as pets or partners, but befriending them as equals.

## Overall Goal(s)

- To have fun with their partners and/or friends with monsters by their side.

- To understand and harness Digital Energy for the bettermen of monsters.

- To protect the digital world (should it exist) from those who would exploit or harm it.

- Monitor the region for digital anomalies and resolve them as needed. (Ideally without violence.)

- Establish themselves as a formal authority on the islands in regards to digital energy and digital lifeforms.
