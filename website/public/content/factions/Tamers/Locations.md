# Locations

> Our headquarters is wherever someone brought snacks and a stable connection.

## Overview

The Tamers don't have official locations. They have meetup spots, someone's living room, and a handful of semi-permanent hubs that exist because one Tamer set up shop and everyone else kept showing up.

## Known Hubs

### The Frequency — Wakinyan City, Thunderbird Heights
The closest thing to a Tamer headquarters. A converted workshop in Wakinyan City that serves as the primary communication hub for the Tamer network. Houses the main relay equipment, a modest server room, and a perpetually cluttered common area. Most Coordinators operate out of here when they need a physical space.

### Vulcan Workshop — Vulcan City, Hephaestus Forge
A hardware lab and repair shop run by a Tamer Anchor. Tamers across the island send broken equipment here and receive it back fixed, upgraded, or transformed into something entirely different. Also the best place to source custom scanning gear.

### Puck's Corner — Puck Town, Seelie Courts
A casual meetup spot in the back of a cafe. The local Tamer group here skews younger and specializes in digital anomaly research near the fairy-influenced zones, where digital energy behaves in ways nobody can fully explain.

## Notes

- Tamer meetups happen everywhere. Any town with enough Tamers will develop an informal gathering spot — a cafe, a park bench, someone's garage.
- The Tamers have no presence on the Sky Isles or the Conoocoo Archipelago. Digital infrastructure in those areas is limited or nonexistent, which makes the Tamers uncomfortable and the locals indifferent.
- If you need to find a Tamer, you're better off scanning the right channels than visiting a location.
