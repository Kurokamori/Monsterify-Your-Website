# Joining and Leaving

> Just hop in the voice chat. We'll figure it out.

## Joining

### Requirements

- You need to have some affinity for digital energy — even a little. If your device has ever glitched in a way that felt *intentional*, you probably qualify.
- You should have at least one monster partner. Doesn't have to be a Digimon, but it helps if you actually like monsters and aren't just here for the tech.
- You need to be able to find the Tamers. This is not a joke. Their recruitment channels are buried in forums, group chats, and local network signals that only people with the right instincts stumble into.

### The Process

1. **Contact** — Find a Tamer, or let one find you. Most new members are spotted by existing Tamers who notice someone with digital sensitivity — a kid whose monsters respond to their devices, a trainer whose Digimon behaves unusually well, someone who just *gets it*.
2. **The Hang** — You'll be invited to a local Tamer meetup. These range from a few people at a cafe to a dozen gathered around someone's home setup running network scans for anomalies. It's casual. They want to see if you're fun to be around.
3. **The Tag** — If the group vibes with you, someone will add you to the Tamer network — a loosely maintained digital registry. You'll get a Tamer handle and access to their shared communication channels.

There is no formal induction. No ceremony. One day you're hanging out with some Tamers, and the next day you realize you *are* one.

### What You Get

- Access to the Tamer communication network — shared intel on digital anomalies, monster behavior, and technology developments.
- Shared tools and scanning equipment for investigating digital energy phenomena.
- A community of people who genuinely enjoy what they do and want to share it.
- Backup when things get weird. And with digital anomalies, things get weird.

## Leaving

### Voluntary Departure

Go offline. That's it. If you stop responding on the channels and stop showing up, the Tamers will assume you've moved on. Someone might check in on you once or twice to make sure you're okay, but they won't pressure you.

Your handle stays in the registry unless you ask for it to be removed. Some former Tamers pop back in years later and pick up right where they left off.

### Involuntary Removal

The Tamers are hard to anger, but they do have limits:

- **Harming digital lifeforms.** Tamers take the protection of digital life seriously. If you're caught exploiting, trapping, or destroying Digimon or other digital entities for personal gain, you're out.
- **Weaponizing the network.** The Tamer communication network is built on trust. Using it to doxx, scam, or otherwise harm people will get you blacklisted instantly.
- **Selling out to Digital Dawn.** The Tamers and Digital Dawn share an interest in digital energy but disagree on everything else. Feeding Tamer intel to Dawn is the fastest way to burn every bridge you have.

Removal means your handle is revoked and your access to the network is cut. It's quiet and efficient. You simply stop being able to reach anyone.

### Returning After Leaving

If you left on your own, just reach out to someone still in the network. You'll be welcomed back without fuss.

If you were removed, you'll need someone willing to vouch for you. Given how tight-knit the community is, that's harder than it sounds — but not impossible if you've genuinely changed.
