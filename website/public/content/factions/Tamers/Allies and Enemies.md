# Allies and Enemies

# Overview

Tamers get along with almost everyone. It's not a strategy — it's just who they are. When your core philosophy is "befriend monsters and protect digital life," you don't make a lot of enemies. The few factions that land in Tamer crosshairs have earned it by threatening the creatures Tamers have sworn to protect. Everyone else is welcome at the campfire.

# Allies

## League

The League respects Tamers' dedication to their monsters, and Tamers enjoy League exhibitions and contests as a chance to show off their bonds. Many Tamers participate in League events — not for rank, but for the joy of it. The League appreciates their enthusiasm, and Tamers appreciate having a structured community that values the trainer-monster relationship.

## Rangers

Rangers and Tamers share the wilds, share a love of monsters, and share a willingness to drop everything when a creature needs help. Tamer-Ranger cooperative rescue operations are common, effective, and often the highlight of both groups' seasons. Rangers value Tamers' unique ability to calm distressed monsters, and Tamers value Rangers' knowledge of the terrain.

## The Tribes

The Tribes trust very few outsiders. Tamers are among them. Their gentle approach, their respect for boundaries, and their genuine love for all living things has earned them a quiet welcome in tribal communities. Some Tamers have been invited to tribal gatherings — an honor that speaks to just how rare and valued their temperament is.

## Ranchers

Tamers love monsters. Ranchers raise monsters. The friendship is obvious and effortless. Many Tamers got their first monster from a ranch, and that origin story creates a bond that lasts a lifetime. Tamers visit ranches to spend time with monsters in open spaces, and Ranchers enjoy the company of people who appreciate what they do without wanting to change it.

## Professor Koa's Lab

The Lab's research on monster bonding, digital energy, and species behavior directly supports Tamer interests. Tamers cooperate willingly with Lab studies, share field data on digital anomalies, and genuinely enjoy the company of researchers who are as curious about monsters as they are.

## Spirit Keepers

Keepers and Tamers connect on a level that goes beyond politics. Both groups believe that the world's creatures — physical, digital, spiritual — deserve reverence and protection. Tamers' instinct to befriend rather than control mirrors the Keepers' philosophy of balance and respect. When spiritual disturbances affect monster behavior, Tamers are often the first to notice and the first to call a Keeper for help.

# Enemies

# Neutral

## Nyakuza

Tamers don't judge the Nyakuza, and the Nyakuza don't bother the Tamers. Some Tamers find Nyakuza company genuinely fun — the stories, the energy, the complete absence of pretension. But there's no formal connection, no shared mission. Just the occasional friendly encounter.

## Project Obsidian

Tamers find Obsidian unsettling. The clinical approach to monsters, the secrecy, the rumors — it all makes Tamers uncomfortable. But Obsidian has never directly harmed a Tamer or their partners, and Tamers aren't the type to start a conflict on suspicion alone. They watch. They worry. They hope they're wrong.

## Digital Dawn

This one hurts. Dawn shares Tamers' connection to digital energy and digital lifeforms, but Dawn's ambition to control and weaponize what Tamers want to protect creates an unbridgeable gap. Tamers see Dawn as friends who lost their way. Dawn sees Tamers as wasted potential. The relationship is distant, polite, and tinged with genuine sadness on both sides.

## Twilight Order

The Order's spiritual pursuits don't conflict with Tamer values, but they don't align either. Tamers find the Order intense and a little intimidating. The Order finds Tamers pleasant but unserious. They coexist without friction — two groups pursuing such different goals that there's nothing to disagree about.
