# Ranks and Structure

> Ranks are for guilds. We're just friends with a group chat.

## Overview

The Tamers barely have a structure. What they have is a network — decentralized, organic, and held together by shared interests and group chats. Nobody gives orders. Nobody files reports. If something needs doing, someone does it. If nobody does it, it probably wasn't that important.

That said, certain Tamers have naturally gravitated into roles that the community recognizes, even if nobody officially assigned them.

## Roles

### Tamer
You're in the network. You have a handle. You show up to meetups and help out when digital weirdness happens. That's it. That's the role.

### Anchor
A Tamer who runs a local meetup group or maintains a regional communication hub. Anchors are the social glue — they organize gatherings, keep channels active, and make sure new Tamers don't feel lost. Not a rank. Just a person who cares enough to keep things running.

### Specialist
A Tamer recognized by the community as particularly skilled in a specific area. Could be digital energy theory, Digimon behavior, network security, hardware engineering, or anomaly response. Specialists are the people everyone pings when something goes sideways in their area of expertise.

### Coordinator
The closest thing the Tamers have to leadership. Coordinators are Tamers who've taken on the unglamorous work of keeping the faction functional — managing the shared registry, coordinating with other factions, handling disputes, and making sure the Tamers are represented when regional decisions are made.

There are only a handful of Coordinators at any time, and the role is filled by whoever's willing to do it. Elections are informal and usually amount to "nobody else wants to, so thanks for volunteering."

### The Envoy
The Tamers' representative to the regional leadership council. Typically one of the Coordinators, chosen by group consensus. The Envoy advocates for digital lifeform protections, technology policy, and the Tamers' interests in regional governance. Most Envoys describe the job as "explaining to people in suits why the internet is alive."

## Notes

- The Tamers have no formal ranks. If someone tries to pull rank on you, they're not really a Tamer.
- Decisions are made through discussion in the network channels. If something's contentious, it gets talked out until consensus emerges or everyone gets bored.
- The lack of structure is both the Tamers' greatest strength and greatest weakness. They're impossible to dismantle, but also impossible to organize quickly.
