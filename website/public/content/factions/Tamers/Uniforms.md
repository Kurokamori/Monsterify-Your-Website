# Uniforms

> Dress code? We're not a corporation. We're barely a club.

## Overview

The Tamers have no official uniform. They're a decentralized group of tech-savvy monster lovers who got organized by accident. Expecting them to dress alike would be like expecting cats to march in formation.

That said, there are patterns. Tamers tend to look like Tamers, even if nobody told them to.

## The Vibe

Tamers dress casual, techy, and a little messy. Hoodies, cargo pants, sneakers, graphic tees, utility vests with too many pockets, wristbands, and goggles pushed up onto foreheads. Bags and belts loaded with devices, cables, and tools. The general aesthetic lands somewhere between "off-duty engineer" and "teenager who hasn't slept in two days because they were debugging something."

Many Tamers accessorize with tech — modified headphones, custom visors, wrist-mounted displays, or devices of their own design. If it blinks, beeps, or connects to a network, a Tamer is probably wearing it.

## The Tag

The one recognizable Tamer identifier is the **Tag** — a small, custom-printed decal or patch featuring the Tamer's handle in stylized text, usually stuck on a bag, jacket, or device. Tags are self-made and no two look alike. Spotting someone's Tag in public is the Tamer equivalent of a secret handshake.

## Colors

No official colors, but Tamers tend to gravitate toward **teal, electric blue, and black** — likely because those are the colors of most of their screens. It's not a rule. It's just what happens.

## Notes

- Coordinators and Anchors don't dress differently from anyone else. The Tamers would find the idea of a leadership uniform hilarious.
- Some Tamers wear matching gear with their Digimon partners. This is considered endearing, not required.
