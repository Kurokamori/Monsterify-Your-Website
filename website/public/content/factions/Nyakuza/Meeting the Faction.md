# Meeting the Faction

> We don't steal. We just find things before people know they're missing.

## Overview

At first they where a problem, appearing at docks, stealing goods, impeding trade, and otherwise being a general nuisance. Then in what seemed like a flash, they where gone. Or so everyone thought.

The Nyakuza have now set up shop on the before believed unhospitable western tip of the island, in what is now called 'Pirate's Bay'. They have a bustling settlement, with a port that never wants for anything. It's rare these days for the Nyakuza to venture to the main ports of the islands, but when they do, the locals are quick to buy up their merchendise and then claim they where unwanted.

Often, it is said, that the Nyakuza have *everything* from rare goods to lost socks to the names of all the women your grandmother ever loved, but the cost is often too great, and the risk to get there too high, for the average person to bother.

But the Nyakuza are not simply merchants, they're a mysterious group of mostly felyne individuals who are almost dangerously fun. They're driven by curiousity, thrill, and meriment, and will go to great lengths to achieve them. But above all else, they are loyal, to their friends, to their families, and to their own.

## Values and Beliefs

- Freedom is the highest virtue. Staying to long in one place is a kind of death.

- Loyalty is the only true currency. Loyalty to your own is absolute.

- Laughter is the best payment (well perhaps other than gold).

- Curiosity is a virtue, caution is sometimes necessary, and boredom is unforgivable.

## Overall Goal(s)

- Maintain the status quo of the Nyakuza. Keep the flow of goods, information, and people moving. Keep the pirates happy. Keep the mainlanders confused.
    - The Nyakuza are aware of the tenious position on the island, and perhaps above all else, they wish to maintain a place on the island where they feel welcome.

- Explore every nook, cranny, and missing spot of the archipelago -- and bring back whatever it is they find.

- Maintain their reputation as charming, unpredictable, and impossible to pin down.

- Stay free — from governments, factions, and anyone who tries to regulate the seas.
