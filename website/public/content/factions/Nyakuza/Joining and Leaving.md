# Joining and Leaving

> You don't ask to join. You prove you belong.

## Joining

### Requirements

- You need guts, charm, or a skill the Nyakuza don't already have enough of. Ideally all three.
- You must be vouched for by an existing member of the crew. Cold introductions don't exist in Pirate's Bay.
- You must be willing to sail to Pirate's Bay yourself. If you can't make the trip, you weren't meant to.

### The Process

The Nyakuza don't recruit. People come to them — or a Nyakuza takes a shine to someone and brings them in. Either way, the path looks roughly the same:

1. **The Introduction** — A current member brings you to the Bay and introduces you to their crew captain. First impressions matter. Be interesting. Be honest. Lie only if you're good enough that they can't tell.
2. **The Run** — You'll be given a job. Could be a trade run. Could be a salvage dive. Could be something stranger. The point isn't whether you succeed — it's how you handle yourself when things go sideways. And things will go sideways.
3. **The Toast** — If the crew likes what they see, you'll be invited to drink with them. When a Nyakuza raises a glass to you by name, you're family. You'll receive your Nyakuza coin — a stamped token unique to your crew — and your place on a ship.

No paperwork. No oaths. Just a drink, a coin, and the understanding that loyalty is the only currency that matters here.

### What You Get

- A crew. Not colleagues, not associates — *crew*. People who will lie for you, fight for you, and split their last meal with you.
- Access to the Nyakuza trade network — the most extensive and least legal supply chain on the archipelago.
- A berth at Pirate's Bay and the protection that comes with it.
- Freedom. The Nyakuza don't tell you where to go or what to do. They just expect you to come back when called.

## Leaving

### Voluntary Departure

You can leave the Nyakuza. It's rare, but it happens. Tell your crew captain, return your coin, and walk.

The Nyakuza won't stop you, but they will be hurt. Leaving a crew is personal, even when it's done right. You'll be treated as a friend of the faction — welcome at the Bay, welcome at the table — but you won't be crew anymore. There's a difference, and everyone knows it.

Some who leave stay in the Nyakuza trade network as independent contacts. The Nyakuza respect the hustle, even from former members.

### Involuntary Removal

The Nyakuza have a short list of unforgivable offenses:

- **Betraying crew.** Selling out a crewmate's location, identity, or secrets to outsiders. This is the worst thing you can do. The consequences are decided by the betrayed crew and are never made public.
- **Stealing from your own.** The Nyakuza steal from everyone. That's fine. Stealing from *each other* is the one line even pirates don't cross.
- **Leading danger to the Bay.** Pirate's Bay is home. If your carelessness or malice brings hostile forces to their doorstep, you are no longer welcome behind it.

Expelled members have their coin broken — literally snapped in half — and are escorted off the Bay. What happens after depends on the severity. For minor offenses, you're simply dead to them. For major ones, the Nyakuza have long memories and longer reaches.

### Returning After Leaving

Former members who left on good terms can return to the Bay and ask to rejoin. You'll need your old crew captain — or a new one — to accept you. If enough time has passed, you may need to do another Run to prove you haven't gone soft.

Former members who were expelled don't come back. There is no appeals process. The Nyakuza are a family, and some things a family doesn't forgive.
