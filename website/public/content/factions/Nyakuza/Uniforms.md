# Uniforms

> Dress like you own the place. Even if you stole everything you're wearing.

## Overview

The Nyakuza don't have uniforms — they have *style*. There's no dress code, no issued gear, no standard-issue anything. But spend five minutes at Pirate's Bay and you'll notice that Nyakuza have a look, even if no one's enforcing it.

## The Look

Bold, layered, and a little theatrical. Nyakuza fashion draws from seafaring practicality and an irrepressible love of flair. Long coats, sashes, bandanas, scarves, vests over loose shirts, high boots, belts with far too many pouches, and at least one piece of jewelry that has a story behind it (ask at your own risk).

Colors are personal but tend toward **rich, saturated tones** — deep reds, purples, teals, golds, and blacks. The Nyakuza like to stand out, even when standing out is inadvisable. Especially then.

Felyne members — who make up a significant portion of the faction — often incorporate ear decorations, tail wraps, and custom-fitted gear designed for their proportions.

## The Coin

The Nyakuza coin is the faction's only universal identifier. Most members wear theirs visibly — on a chain around the neck, stitched into a hat band, or dangling from a belt. It's a point of pride. Crews often customize their coins with enamel, engraving, or embedded gems.

## Crew Identity

Individual crews often develop their own visual identity — a shared color, a particular style of coat, matching bandanas, or a crew-specific symbol displayed on sails, flags, and gear. This isn't mandated. It just happens when a group of people spend enough time together on a boat.

## Notes

- The only fashion rule in the Nyakuza is that looking boring is worse than looking ridiculous.
- Captains tend to dress the most extravagantly. It's not a requirement — it's a competition.
- Nyakuza who operate on the mainland often tone down the pirate aesthetic to blend in. They hate every second of it.
