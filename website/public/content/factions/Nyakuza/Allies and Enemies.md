# Allies and Enemies

# Overview

The Nyakuza don't do politics. They do business, favors, and grudges — and they remember all three. Most factions either want to use them or shut them down, and the Nyakuza are perfectly happy keeping everyone guessing about which side of that line they're standing on today.

# Allies

## Digital Dawn

The only faction the Nyakuza genuinely respect. Dawn needs rare tech, black-market components, and information that doesn't exist on any official registry. The Nyakuza have all of it. In return, Dawn provides the Nyakuza with cutting-edge gadgets, secure communications, and the occasional digital favor that makes certain records disappear. It's a friendship built on mutual usefulness — which, to the Nyakuza, is the only kind worth having.

# Enemies

## League

The League wants order. The Nyakuza want freedom. These two things have never gotten along. League officials seize Nyakuza contraband on sight, patrol trade routes to intercept pirate vessels, and publicly condemn everything Pirate's Bay stands for. The Nyakuza, for their part, find the League insufferably stiff and take enormous pleasure in slipping through their fingers. It's a rivalry that's almost become tradition at this point — and both sides secretly enjoy it more than they'd admit.

## Rangers

Rangers patrol the wilds. Nyakuza use the wilds as smuggling routes. The math writes itself. Rangers are the faction most likely to actually catch a Nyakuza operative in the act, and the Nyakuza respect their competence enough to consider them a genuine nuisance. There's no hatred here — just two groups whose jobs put them on opposite sides of the same trail, over and over again.

## The Tribes

The Tribes guard their lands fiercely, and the Nyakuza have a bad habit of treating "forbidden territory" as an invitation. Tribal waters, tribal ruins, tribal secrets — the Nyakuza want access to all of it, and the Tribes want them gone. Relations are openly hostile when they cross paths, though the Nyakuza are smart enough not to push too hard. Some doors aren't worth kicking down, even for gold.

# Neutral

## Project Obsidian

Obsidian and the Nyakuza orbit each other warily. Obsidian has money and occasionally needs things acquired discreetly. The Nyakuza are happy to provide — for the right price. But the Nyakuza don't trust scientists who treat living things as lab supplies, and Obsidian doesn't trust anyone who might sell their secrets to the highest bidder. The arrangement works precisely because neither side expects loyalty.

## Koa's Laboratory

The Lab doesn't bother the Nyakuza, and the Nyakuza don't bother the Lab. Occasionally a Nyakuza sailor brings back a strange specimen and drops it at a Lab outpost, no questions asked. Koa's researchers have learned not to ask where it came from. It's not friendship — it's a quiet mutual acknowledgment that curiosity comes in many forms.

## Spirit Keepers

The Nyakuza leave the Keepers alone. Not out of respect, exactly — more out of a healthy superstition. Messing with people who commune with spirits feels like bad luck, and the Nyakuza are nothing if not superstitious sailors. The Keepers, meanwhile, have no interest in pirates unless they're disturbing sacred sites. So far, they haven't.

## Twilight Order

The Order is too weird for even the Nyakuza to get a read on. They buy odd things occasionally — ritual components, old texts, artifacts nobody else wants — and they pay well and on time. That's enough for a business relationship. Beyond that, the Nyakuza give the Order a wide berth. Zealots with spiritual powers aren't the kind of customers you want to shortchange.

## Ranchers

No beef. Ranchers grow food. Nyakuza eat food. Ranchers don't ask where the gold comes from, and the Nyakuza don't steal from farms. There's an unspoken understanding between working people — you don't mess with someone's livelihood. Some Nyakuza even have family on ranches. It's the quietest, most unremarkable peace on the islands.

## Tamers

Tamers are too friendly and too harmless for the Nyakuza to consider them anything but background noise. Some Nyakuza genuinely enjoy Tamer company — they're fun, they're easygoing, and they don't judge. But there's no formal relationship, no trade deals, no mutual obligations. Just the occasional shared campfire and the understanding that neither group is the other's problem.
