# Ranks and Structure

## Overview

The Nyakuza are organized around ships and crews, not ranks and titles. Authority comes from loyalty, reputation, and the ability to keep your crew alive and profitable. The structure is flat by design — pirates don't do well with too many bosses.

## Roles

### Crewmate
You've got your coin. You're on a ship. You do what needs doing — sailing, trading, scouting, fighting, cooking, or whatever the crew needs today. Most Nyakuza are crewmates and prefer it that way.

### Specialist
A crewmate recognized for a particular skill that makes them indispensable. Navigators, monster handlers, fences (goods dealers), intelligence gatherers, shipwrights, and medics all fall here. Specialists aren't ranked above other crewmates — they just can't be easily replaced, and everyone knows it.

### First Mate
The captain's right hand. First Mates handle crew logistics, settle disputes before they reach the captain, and take command when the captain is absent. A good First Mate is the reason a crew functions. A bad one is the reason it falls apart.

### Captain
Leader of a crew and its ship. Captains are chosen by their crew — not appointed from above. A captain who loses the crew's trust will lose the title, one way or another. Captains set their crew's direction, negotiate deals with other crews and outside contacts, and take responsibility when things go wrong.

### The Harbormasters
A small council of senior captains who manage Pirate's Bay itself — dock assignments, trade disputes between crews, defense of the settlement, and relations with the mainland. Harbormasters are elected by the captains and serve until they step down, lose a vote of confidence, or die in some spectacularly unfortunate way.

### The Envoy
The Nyakuza's representative to the regional leadership council — assuming they choose to send one, which they don't always. The Envoy is typically a Harbormaster or a captain trusted enough to speak for the Bay. Their job is equal parts diplomat and con artist: keeping the Nyakuza's interests protected while revealing as little as possible about how the faction actually operates.

## Crews

The crew is the fundamental unit of the Nyakuza. Each crew operates semi-independently — they choose their own jobs, set their own routes, and keep their own profits (minus the Bay's modest harbor tax).

Crews range from a handful of members on a small sloop to several dozen on the largest trading vessels. Each develops its own reputation, specialties, and culture. Some crews are known for daring exploration, others for shrewd trading, others for the kind of work that doesn't get discussed in polite company.

Rivalry between crews is common, expected, and mostly friendly. *Mostly.*

## Notes

- There is no "Nyakuza leader." The Harbormasters manage the Bay, but no one commands the faction as a whole. Attempts to centralize authority have historically ended in mutiny.
- A captain's power is absolute on their ship and nonexistent off it. On shore, all Nyakuza are equals.
- Crews can be formed and dissolved freely. If a captain loses their crew or a group of crewmates wants to strike out on their own, that's their right.
