## Pirate's Bay

The Nyakuza's home territory, occupying the western tip of Conoco Island. Once considered inhospitable, now a thriving — if chaotic — settlement built by and for pirates.

### Pirate Port
The main docks. A sprawling, noisy mess of piers, warehouses, taverns, and market stalls where anything can be bought, sold, or "found." The Harbormasters operate from a fortified building at the port's center — the closest thing the Nyakuza have to a town hall.

### Pirate Village
The residential heart of the Bay. Shanty lanes, hammock houses, crew quarters, and communal kitchens. It looks haphazard but has its own logic — every Nyakuza knows exactly which alley leads where.

### Hidden Cove
A sheltered inlet used for private dealings, ship repairs, and storing cargo that shouldn't be seen from the main port. Access is restricted to trusted crew members.

### Nyakuza Landing
The fortified beachhead facing the open sea. The Bay's first line of defense and the last thing unfriendly visitors see before being turned away.

### Skull Rock
A natural rock formation at the Bay's outer edge, riddled with caves and tunnels. Used for storage, hiding, and — according to rumor — the Nyakuza's most sensitive meetings.

## Mainland Contacts

The Nyakuza maintain no official presence on the rest of the island, but they have contacts and safe houses in most port towns and trade cities. These change frequently and are known only to the crews that use them.

## Notes

- Pirate's Bay is sovereign Nyakuza territory. Other factions don't patrol it, don't govern it, and don't visit without invitation.
- The Rangers maintain a border post at the edge of the Bay but don't enter. Both sides prefer it this way.
