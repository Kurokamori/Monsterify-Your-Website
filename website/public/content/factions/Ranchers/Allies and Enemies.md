# Allies and Enemies

# Overview

Ranchers don't go looking for trouble, but they know exactly where it lives. As the backbone of the archipelago's food supply and monster care, they've earned relationships with nearly everyone — and the few factions that have earned their distrust have done so by threatening the things Ranchers hold sacred: the land, the monsters, and the communities that depend on both.

# Allies

## Rangers

The most natural friendship on the islands. Rangers protect the wilds; Ranchers tend the land. They share the same soil, the same values, and often the same kitchen table. Ranger outposts near ranch territory are always welcome, and Ranchers provide provisions, shelter, and local knowledge without being asked. Many families have members in both factions. It's less an alliance and more a family bond.

## Spirit Keepers

Ranchers and Keepers share a deep reverence for the natural world, even if they express it differently. Ranchers work the land with their hands; Keepers honor it with their spirits. When a Rancher's field goes sour or a herd starts acting strange, a Spirit Keeper is often the first person they call. In return, Keepers trust Ranchers to treat sacred ground with respect. It's a quiet, ancient partnership that neither side talks about much but both depend on.

## The Tribes

The Tribes and the Ranchers have coexisted for generations. Tribal lands border ranch territory in several regions, and the understanding between them is simple: you don't cross my fence, I don't cross yours. But it's warmer than that suggests — Ranchers trade goods with tribal communities, respect their customs without prying, and have been known to shelter tribal members without asking questions. The Tribes return the favor in kind.

## Tamers

Tamers love monsters. Ranchers raise monsters. The connection is obvious and effortless. Tamers visit ranches to bond with monsters in open pastures, and Ranchers enjoy having people around who appreciate the work without wanting to monetize it. Many Tamers got their first monster from a Rancher, and that bond tends to stick.

## Professor Koa's Lab

The Lab's research on monster health, breeding, and ecology directly benefits ranching operations. Koa's researchers are frequent visitors to ranches, studying monster behavior in domestic settings, and Ranchers are happy to provide data in exchange for veterinary expertise and new techniques. It's a practical partnership with genuine mutual appreciation.

# Enemies

# Neutral

## League

The League and the Ranchers get along fine — they just don't overlap much. The League governs the cities and the arenas; Ranchers govern the fields and the pastures. Occasionally a Rancher's kid enters a tournament and does surprisingly well. The League enjoys that. Beyond that, they leave each other alone, which is the Rancher ideal of a good neighbor.

## Project Obsidian

Everything Obsidian stands for makes a Rancher's blood boil. Treating monsters as test subjects, altering their fundamental nature for profit, viewing living creatures as raw material — it's an affront to everything Ranchers believe. Ranchers have refused Obsidian access to their herds and their land repeatedly, and they've been vocal about it. Obsidian considers this sentimental obstruction. Ranchers consider it basic decency.

## Digital Dawn

Dawn's belief that non-digital monsters are "inferior" is enough to earn a permanent cold shoulder from every ranch on the islands. Ranchers have raised, loved, and depended on their monsters for generations, and they don't take kindly to anyone calling them second-class. Beyond the ideological clash, Dawn's technology-first approach to the natural world feels like a threat to everything Ranchers have built. The distance between them is deliberate and firm.

## Nyakuza

The Nyakuza buy Rancher goods at fair prices and don't steal from farms. That's enough for a Rancher to consider you decent folk, regardless of what else you get up to. Some Ranchers have Nyakuza relatives. Nobody talks about it at dinner, but nobody pretends it isn't true either.

## Twilight Order

Ranchers find the Order strange but harmless. As long as the Order isn't trampling crops or disturbing herds, Ranchers don't much care what they do in their towers. The Order, for its part, has no particular interest in agricultural communities. They coexist through mutual indifference.
