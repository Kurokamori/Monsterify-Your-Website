> We don't need offices. We need barns.

## Overview

The Ranchers don't have a headquarters in any grand sense. They have homesteads, and one of those homesteads handles the paperwork. Most Rancher business happens at regional gatherings held at rotating farms — not in buildings with plaques on the door.

## The Grange — Hygge Village, Hearthfall Commons

The closest thing the Ranchers have to a central office. The Grange is a large communal barn and meeting hall in Hygge Village where records are kept, trade disputes are mediated, and the Regional Speaker for Hearthfall Commons holds court. It smells like hay and strong coffee. There is always soup on.

## Regional Offices

Small, practical outposts that handle trade coordination, breeding records, and supply logistics. Not staffed full-time — a local Senior Rancher manages each one as needed.

- **Ceres Stockhouse** — Ceres Town, Demeter's Grove. Manages the agricultural heartland's seed banks and harvest exchanges.
- **Frost Barn** — Frost Village, Jötun Tundra. Coordinates cold-weather herding and emergency winter supplies.
- **Terra Depot** — Terra Village, Terra Madre Basin. Oversees grazing land allocation and migratory corridor management.

## Notes

- Gatherings rotate between homesteads within each region. There is no fixed meeting location — the host provides the space and the food.
- Ranchers are everywhere that farming happens, which is most of the island. These offices exist for coordination, not control.
