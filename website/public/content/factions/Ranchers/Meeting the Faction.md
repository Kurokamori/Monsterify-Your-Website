# Meeting the Faction

> There's nothing a certain as the trust of a monster. Never betray it.

## Overview

The Ranchers is a loose faction organized and maintained by and for the Ranchers on the archipelago. While the faction itself has goals, values, and a hierarchy, it is at its core a loose organization of individuals who share a common love for monsters and a desire to protect and care for them. Individual Ranchers can and do affliate with other factions, some expressly (like the League), while others hold secret ties that the Ranchers organization does little to police.

The Ranchers themselves are a varied lot, but all share a common love for monsters and a desire to protect and care for them. Some are former trainers, some are former researchers, and some are simply people who have a knack for understanding and caring for monsters.

Because the Ranchers themselves hold such a core place in society, almost single handedly providing all the food, clothes, and basic goods for the islands, it is difficult for any real governance to occur. Because of this many Ranchers are only loose affiliates of the faction.

Those that truly are part of the faction are those that have truly dedicated themselves and their farms or ranches to the bettermen of society, the lives of the people and monsters on the island, and the natural well being of the archipelago. Ranchers are also some of the most in tune with monsters and their happenings, and as such are often called upon to help settle disputes, provide insight into monster behavior, and to simply be a calming presence in times of crisis.
