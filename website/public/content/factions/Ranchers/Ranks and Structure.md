# Ranks and Structure

> We don't do ranks. We do respect.

## Overview

The Ranchers don't have a formal hierarchy. Never have, probably never will. What they have is a loose web of mutual respect, regional gatherings, and the unspoken understanding that the people who've been doing this longest know what they're talking about.

## Roles

### Homesteader
The baseline. You run a farm, a ranch, or a sanctuary. You attend gatherings when you can. You trade with your neighbors. You're a Rancher.

### Senior Rancher
Not a title anyone bestows — it's just what people call the Ranchers who've been at it long enough that everyone else turns to them for advice. Senior Ranchers tend to host gatherings, mediate disputes, and quietly organize emergency aid when someone's barn collapses or a herd goes sick.

### Regional Speaker
Each region of the archipelago has one Speaker, chosen by loose consensus at gatherings. The Speaker represents the Ranchers' interests when dealing with other factions, local governance, or land disputes. It's a thankless job, and most Speakers would rather be home tending their herds.

### The Envoy
The Ranchers' representative to the regional leadership council. Currently a rotating position — no single Rancher wants the job for long. The Envoy speaks for the faction as a whole on matters of island-wide policy, trade agreements, and ecological management. They carry the collective voice of the gatherings, not their own opinion.

## Specializations

Ranchers don't have formal divisions, but they do tend to specialize:

- **Breeders** — Focused on monster breeding, lineage tracking, and egg care.
- **Grazers** — Large-scale herders managing migratory monster populations across open land.
- **Sanctuary Keepers** — Operators of rescue and rehabilitation centers for injured or abandoned monsters.
- **Harvesters** — Focused on sustainable resource gathering — wool, milk, berries, and other monster-derived goods.

These aren't ranks or assignments. They're just what you do.

## Notes

- There is no formal chain of command. If a Senior Rancher tells you something, you're free to ignore it. You'd just be unwise to.
- Gatherings are the closest thing to governance. Decisions are made by discussion and consensus, not by vote or decree.
- The Ranchers have no enforcement arm. Their only real power is the trade network — and being cut off from it is punishment enough.
