# Uniforms

> We wear what works.

## Overview

The Ranchers don't have uniforms. They don't have a dress code. They don't have colors. If you told a Rancher they needed to wear a specific outfit to tend their herd, they'd laugh you off the property.

## What Ranchers Wear

Whatever's practical. Heavy boots, wide-brimmed hats, thick gloves, leather aprons, overalls, sun-bleached shirts held together by stubbornness. Rancher fashion is dictated by climate, terrain, and whatever didn't get ruined last season. You'll find wool and furs in the tundra regions, linen and straw hats near the coast, and fire-resistant gear near the volcanic ranges.

The only common thread is that everything looks *worn*. Ranchers don't buy new clothes until the old ones are beyond repair, and their definition of "beyond repair" is generous.

## The Brand Mark

The closest thing Ranchers have to an insignia. The brand mark is an iron stamp — each Rancher receives one when they join — used to mark their homestead, their goods, and occasionally their gear. It's a simple design: a circle with a stylized monster silhouette in the center.

Some Ranchers stitch or burn the brand mark into a hat, belt, or jacket. Others never bother. It's entirely optional.

## Regional Variation

Rancher attire varies wildly by region. A coastal fisher-rancher and a highland herder look nothing alike. This is considered a feature, not a problem. The Ranchers have no interest in looking uniform. They have interest in not getting rained on.

## Notes

- There is no expectation to dress any particular way at gatherings. Show up in your work clothes. Everyone else will.
- Senior Ranchers and Regional Speakers don't dress differently from anyone else. If anything, they tend to look more weathered.
