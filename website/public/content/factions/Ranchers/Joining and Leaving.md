# Joining and Leaving

> Pull up a chair. There's always room at the table.

## Joining

### Requirements

- You must own, operate, or meaningfully contribute to a ranch, farm, or monster sanctuary on the archipelago.
- You must have at least one monster in your care — not necessarily bonded, just cared for.
- You must be vouched for by an existing Rancher *or* demonstrate a track record of honest work with monsters. Neighbors talk. The Ranchers will have heard of you before you ask.

### The Process

1. **Show Up** — There is no office. No form. You attend a regional Rancher gathering — they happen monthly at rotating homesteads — and you introduce yourself. Bring food. Seriously.
2. **The Vouch** — Someone who knows your work speaks for you. If nobody knows you, you'll be invited to help out on a few ranches first. Think of it less as a trial and more as getting to know the family.
3. **The Handshake** — If the gathering agrees you belong, you're in. You'll receive the Rancher's brand mark — a simple iron stamp you can press into leather, wood, or signage to mark your homestead as Rancher-affiliated.

There are no dues. No tests. No politics. If you do honest work and treat your monsters right, you're one of them.

### What You Get

- Access to the Rancher trade network — shared breeding stock, seasonal supply exchanges, and emergency feed stores.
- Priority access to Rancher-affiliated grazing lands and migratory corridors.
- A voice at regional gatherings.
- The quiet, unshakable support of people who will show up at your door with supplies when things go wrong, no questions asked.

## Leaving

### Voluntary Departure

Tell someone, or don't. The Ranchers won't chase you. If you stop showing up to gatherings and stop working the land, you've left. It's that simple.

Most who leave just got restless. Wanted to battle, wanted to travel, wanted something the quiet life couldn't give them. The Ranchers understand. The door stays open.

### Involuntary Removal

The Ranchers have exactly one rule that will get you cast out immediately: **monster abuse or neglect.** There is no council, no vote, no appeal process. Word spreads through the network, and you are simply no longer welcome. Your brand mark is expected to be returned or destroyed.

Beyond that, the Ranchers are slow to anger. Disputes over land, resources, or methods are handled at gatherings through discussion — often loud, sometimes heated, but always resolved over a meal.

### Returning After Leaving

Come back to a gathering. Bring food. You're in again. The Ranchers don't keep grudges over people who left peacefully.

If you were cast out for abuse, you will need to demonstrate sustained change over time. The network has a long memory, but not an unforgiving one. Someone will eventually vouch for you — or they won't.
