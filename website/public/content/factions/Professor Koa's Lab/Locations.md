# Locations

> There's a Lab outpost wherever there's something worth studying. So, everywhere.

## Headquarters

### The Main Laboratory — Heimdal City, Hearthfall Commons
The heart of the operation. A sprawling research campus in central Heimdal City housing the primary research departments, the archives, lecture halls, specimen collections, and Professor Koa's perpetually cluttered personal office. The Lab's review board meets here, and most major research initiatives are coordinated from this location.

## Research Outposts

The Lab maintains small, semi-independent outposts across the island, each staffed by a handful of researchers focused on their region's unique phenomena.

- **Pyre Research Station** — Agni City, Agni Peaks. Volcanic geology and fire-type monster biology. Shares data with the Rangers' Firefighting Division.
- **Reef Lab** — Nereid Harbor, Poseidon's Reach. Marine biology and aquatic type studies. The Lab's largest outpost outside Heimdal.
- **Grove Observatory** — Persephone Village, Demeter's Grove. Plant-monster symbiosis and seasonal ecological research.
- **Tundra Station** — Rimeheart Town, Jötun Tundra. Ice-type biology and climate studies. Small staff, harsh conditions, excellent data.
- **Marsh Lab** — Cauldron Village, Crowsfoot Marsh. Toxicology and poison-type research. The smell is apparently worth it.
- **Sanctum Annex** — Delphi City, Oracle's Sanctum. Psychic phenomena research. The Lab's most controversial outpost — hard science meets things that resist measurement.
- **Silk Archive** — Kumasi City, Anansi Woods. Entomology and bug-type behavioral studies.
- **Dragon Studies Post** — Wisdom Town, Long Valley. Dragon-type biology and behavior. Small team, high prestige, significant danger.

## Field Contributor Drop Points

The Lab maintains simple drop boxes and check-in points at most major towns across the island where Field Contributors can submit observations, samples, and reports. These aren't staffed locations — just a locked box and a mailing address.

## Notes

- The Lab has no presence on the Sky Isles or Conoocoo Archipelago, though Professor Koa has publicly expressed interest in establishing research partnerships with the peoples there. So far, no takers.
- Lab outposts operate on the goodwill of their host communities. They provide educational services and share non-sensitive findings in exchange for space and cooperation.
