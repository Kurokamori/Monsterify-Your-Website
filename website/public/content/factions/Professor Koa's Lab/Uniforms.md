# Uniforms

> Lab coats are optional. Curiosity is not.

## Overview

The Lab has a professional dress culture rather than a strict uniform. Staff are expected to look presentable and wear appropriate safety gear when required, but beyond that, Professor Koa has never seen the point in dictating what people wear to think.

## Lab Colors

**White** and **sky blue**, with **green** accents. These appear on signage, publications, and the Lab's crest — an open book beneath a stylized monster silhouette.

## General Staff

Researchers and students working in the main Lab or outposts typically wear a **lab coat** — white, with the Lab's crest on the breast pocket and their department color on the sleeve cuff. Beneath the coat, people wear whatever they like. The hallways of Heimdal City's main lab are a mix of business casual, field gear, and the occasional person who clearly slept in their office.

Department colors on the sleeve cuff:
- **Biology** — Green
- **Ecology** — Brown
- **Type Theory** — Blue
- **Fusion Research** — Purple
- **Alter Studies** — Gold

## Field Contributors

Field Contributors receive a **Field Contributor's Badge** — a small enamel pin in sky blue and white — and a standard-issue field journal. There is no dress expectation. You're in the field. Wear what keeps you alive.

## Department Heads and Senior Staff

No additional uniform requirements. Some Department Heads wear their lab coats like armor. Others haven't touched theirs in years. Professor Koa himself is most often seen in a rumpled button-down with the sleeves rolled up, frequently with dirt on it from whatever specimen he was examining that morning.

## Notes

- Safety gear (goggles, gloves, protective aprons) is mandatory in lab environments. This is the one dress code the Lab enforces without exception.
- The Lab coat is a symbol of affiliation, not authority. Students and Professors wear the same coat.
- Outpost staff in remote regions tend to dress more like Rangers than researchers. Nobody complains.
