# Professor Koa's Lab

The heart of education and research on the islands, with the main laboratory in Heimdal City and outposts across the region. Led by Professor Koa, the Lab is dedicated to understanding fusions, type changes, and alters — while serving as neutral ground between factions and mentoring the next generation of adventurers.
