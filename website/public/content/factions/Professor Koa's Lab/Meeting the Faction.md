# Meeting the Faction

> Every creature has something to teach us. We just have to sit down and be willing to listen.

## Overview

With the main laboratory in the heart of Heimdal City, and outshoots in almost every region of the island, Professor Koa's Lab is the heart of education and research on the islands. From the youngest children to the oldest scholars, Koa's Lab is where the next generation of leaders, thinkers, and doers are trained.

Professor Koa himself is a well renowned researcher and the island's current leading professor. However, there are downsides to the size of a such a laboratory. While most professors dwell in a small alcove of the region, toiling away, Professor Koa has expanded (some say, against his will) into a massive region-wide science center. This means he is no longer able to supervise every choice, every movement, every test.

Nevertheless, the Laboratory claims a squeaky clean rap sheet, of working towards understanding the new fusions, type changes, and alters that have appeared in this world. 

It is almost impossible to say what the Laboratory or Koa himself know, but it is, without a doubt, more than they're letting on.

## Values and Beliefs

- All monsters and people deserve to be understood, and to be treated with respect and dignity.

- Knowledge shared is knowledge kept. Knowledge hoarded is knowledge lost.

- The next generation of adventurers are one of the most valuable resources on the islands.

- Peaceful coexistence is the only way forward.

## Overall Goal(s)

- Document and understand the relationships between the different monster species.

- Uncover the root of type changes and fusions.

- Uncover the root of the "fallers" and their connection to the recent changes in the islands.

- Serve as a neutral ground for discussion and research between different factions and groups.
