# Allies and Enemies

# Overview

The Laboratory's mission is to understand the world — all of it, without prejudice or agenda. That philosophy makes Koa's Lab the most broadly connected faction on the islands. They'll work with almost anyone who has data to share, which means they have allies in surprising places and enemies in very few. The downside is that some of those allies are working toward goals the Lab would rather not examine too closely.

# Allies

## League

The League funds expeditions, protects field researchers, and shares battle data that would take years to collect independently. In return, the Lab provides species research, starter distributions, and the kind of institutional credibility that makes League policy look informed rather than arbitrary. It's a deeply productive partnership, and both sides know it.

## Project Obsidian

The Lab's most controversial relationship. On paper, Obsidian is an extension of Koa's research network — a specialized division pursuing advanced biological studies. In practice, Obsidian pushes ethical boundaries that make many Lab researchers deeply uncomfortable. But Obsidian's data is extraordinary, their findings are real, and cutting ties would mean losing access to research that could take decades to replicate. Koa maintains the partnership with open eyes and a troubled conscience.

## Digital Dawn

Dawn's computational resources and digital expertise have accelerated Lab research in ways that would have been impossible alone. Their understanding of Digimon and digital energy fills gaps in the Lab's knowledge base, and joint projects have produced some of the most cited papers in the archipelago. The Lab is careful to keep Dawn's more radical ambitions at arm's length, but the scientific collaboration is genuinely valuable.

## Twilight Order

An unlikely partnership. The Order's knowledge of spiritual phenomena, yokai behavior, and metaphysical energy patterns provides data that no other faction can offer. Lab researchers approach it with scientific rigor; the Order approaches it with mystical reverence. Somehow, they meet in the middle often enough to produce real results.

## Ranchers

Ranchers provide something no laboratory can simulate — generations of firsthand experience with monster behavior in natural settings. Their herds are living datasets, their knowledge of breeding and temperament is encyclopedic, and their willingness to host field researchers makes rural studies possible. The Lab repays this with veterinary support, breeding research, and genuine gratitude.

## Tamers

Tamers' unique connection to digital energy and their protective approach to all lifeforms makes them valuable research partners. They provide field observations on digital anomalies, cooperate with Lab studies on monster-human bonding, and their easygoing nature makes them pleasant to work with.

# Enemies

# Neutral

## Rangers

Rangers and the Lab respect each other but don't collaborate as closely as outsiders might expect. Rangers are field-focused and action-oriented; the Lab is methodical and data-driven. Their timelines don't align well. Still, Rangers share ecological data when they can, and Lab research occasionally informs Ranger conservation policy.

## Spirit Keepers

The Keepers' spiritual practices fascinate Lab researchers, but the Keepers aren't interested in being studied. They'll share knowledge on their own terms, when they feel it's appropriate, and not a moment sooner. When the Keepers do engage, the insights are invaluable — but it happens rarely enough that the relationship stays firmly in neutral territory.

## Nyakuza

The Lab doesn't officially deal with pirates. Unofficially, strange specimens occasionally arrive at Lab outposts with no sender listed, and no one asks where they came from. Koa's researchers are scientists first and moralists second — if the data is good, the source is a secondary concern.

## The Tribes

The one faction that actively resists Lab contact. Tribal lands contain some of the most unexplored ecosystems in the archipelago, and the Lab would give almost anything for access. The Tribes have said no, repeatedly and firmly. Some Lab researchers have pushed too hard, and those encounters have left lasting damage. The relationship is strained by the Lab's hunger for knowledge and the Tribes' absolute commitment to privacy.
