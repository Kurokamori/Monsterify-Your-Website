# Joining and Leaving

> Curiosity is the only prerequisite. Everything else can be taught.

## Joining

### Requirements

- You must demonstrate a genuine interest in learning about monsters — their biology, behavior, ecology, or any related field.
- There is no age requirement. The Lab has taken on children as young as ten and scholars well into their twilight years.
- You do not need to own a monster, though most members eventually bond with one through the course of their work.

### The Process

The Lab offers multiple paths in, depending on what you're looking for:

#### As a Student

1. **Application** — Submit a written application to any Lab outpost or the main laboratory in Heimdal City. It doesn't need to be long. Professor Koa has been quoted saying he cares more about "one good question" than a stack of credentials.
2. **Placement** — You'll be assigned to a research group or educational track based on your interests and experience. New students are paired with a mentor — usually a senior researcher or graduate aide.
3. **Enrollment** — Once placed, you receive Lab credentials, access to the archives, and a truly unreasonable amount of reading material.

#### As a Researcher

1. **Proposal** — Submit a research proposal to the Lab's review board. This can be an ongoing personal project or a request to join an existing Lab initiative.
2. **Review** — The board evaluates the proposal for scientific merit and ethical compliance. Approval rates are high — the Lab is hungry for fresh perspectives.
3. **Appointment** — Approved researchers receive lab space, funding (modest, but reliable), and access to the full breadth of the Lab's archives and specimen collections.

#### As a Field Contributor

Not everyone wants to sit in a lab. The Lab maintains an open registry for trainers, rangers, and other field-active individuals willing to submit observations, samples, or reports from the field. Registration is as simple as signing up at any outpost. You'll receive a field journal and instructions on what data the Lab is currently looking for.

### What You Get

- Access to the most comprehensive monster research archives on the archipelago.
- Mentorship from leading researchers in monster biology, ecology, and behavior.
- Lab-issued equipment for fieldwork or research.
- A neutral reputation — the Lab's standing with other factions means its members can go places others cannot.

## Leaving

### Voluntary Departure

Submit a notice to your outpost or department head. There is a two-week courtesy period to wrap up any shared research or hand off ongoing projects, but it's a courtesy, not a requirement.

Your research contributions remain in the Lab's archives — attributed to you, permanently. Knowledge shared is knowledge kept.

### Involuntary Removal

The Lab will revoke membership for:

- **Research fraud or data fabrication.** The Lab's credibility is its most valuable asset. Compromise it and you're gone.
- **Ethical violations.** The Lab has strict guidelines on the treatment of monsters in research. Violating them results in immediate removal and a report filed with regional authorities.
- **Espionage.** Funneling Lab research to outside organizations without authorization — particularly to groups like Project Obsidian — is grounds for permanent expulsion. The Lab is aware of what it knows and is very careful about where that knowledge goes.

Removed members lose their credentials and archive access. Published research under their name remains in the record, but their active affiliation is scrubbed.

### Returning After Leaving

Former members who left voluntarily can reapply at any time. The process is expedited — the Lab remembers good work.

Former members who were expelled may appeal to the Lab's ethics board. These cases are reviewed individually and with the same rigor the Lab applies to everything else. The Lab believes in correction, not punishment — but it does not believe in repeating mistakes.
