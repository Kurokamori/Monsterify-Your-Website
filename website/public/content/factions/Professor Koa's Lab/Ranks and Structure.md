# Ranks and Structure

> Knowledge doesn't care about your title. But funding does.

## Overview

The Lab runs like a university crossed with a research institute. There's a clear hierarchy on paper, but in practice, a brilliant student can command more respect than a tenured researcher if their work is good enough. Professor Koa has always insisted that ideas matter more than credentials — though the people who manage the budget might disagree.

## Academic Ranks

### Field Contributor
Not technically Lab staff. Field Contributors are registered trainers and travelers who submit observations and data from the field. They receive a field journal and basic guidelines but operate independently. Many never set foot in Heimdal City.

### Student
Enrolled in one of the Lab's educational programs. Students attend lectures, assist with research, and work under a mentor. The Lab doesn't distinguish between ages — a twelve-year-old and a sixty-year-old sit in the same classes if they're studying the same subject.

### Research Aide
A student who has demonstrated enough competence to assist directly on active research projects. Aides handle data collection, specimen care, and preliminary analysis. It's the stage where you stop reading about the work and start doing it.

### Researcher
A full member of the Lab's research staff with an approved project or permanent assignment to a research team. Researchers have lab space, modest funding, and the authority to publish under the Lab's name.

### Senior Researcher
An experienced researcher who leads a research team or manages a Lab outpost. Senior Researchers review proposals, mentor junior staff, and help set the Lab's research priorities. Promotion is based on published work and peer review — not seniority.

### Department Head
Each major field of study — monster biology, ecology, type theory, fusion research, alter studies — has a Department Head who oversees all research in that area. Department Heads sit on the Lab's review board and advise Professor Koa directly.

### Professor Koa
The Lab's founder and director. Koa sets the overall vision, approves major initiatives, and serves as the public face of the institution. He is also, by most accounts, deeply uncomfortable with how large his operation has become and would prefer to be in the field cataloguing beetles.

### The Envoy
The Lab's representative to the regional leadership council. Usually a Department Head or Senior Researcher appointed by Koa. The Envoy advocates for research funding, educational access, and the Lab's role as neutral ground between factions. The Lab's envoy is often called upon to provide expert testimony on monster-related policy.

## Outpost Structure

The Lab maintains outposts across the archipelago, each staffed by a small team led by a Senior Researcher or experienced Researcher. Outposts operate semi-independently — they set their own local research priorities while contributing data to the main Lab in Heimdal City.

## Notes

- The Lab's review board — composed of Department Heads and Senior Researchers — approves all new research proposals and handles ethical oversight.
- Academic rank does not confer authority over people outside your research team. A Department Head cannot order a Researcher from another department to do anything.
- The Lab's neutrality is its most valuable political asset. Staff are expected to maintain professional relationships with all factions, even the ones they personally disagree with.
