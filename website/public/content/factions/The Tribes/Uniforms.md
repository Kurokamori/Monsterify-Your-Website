# Uniforms

> Our clothes are not costumes. They are who we are.

## Overview

The tribes do not have uniforms. They have cultural dress — garments, adornments, and markings that carry the weight of identity, history, and belonging. What a tribe member wears is not a fashion choice. It is a statement of who they are and where they come from.

Outsiders are reminded, firmly, that tribal dress is not a costume to be imitated.

## The Old Ones

The Old Ones dress in muted, natural tones — **browns, deep greens, greys, and black**. Their garments are simple in cut but rich in detail: intricate weaving patterns, subtle embroidery, and small ornaments made from stone, bone, and wood. Clothing is handmade from locally sourced materials and designed to blend with the dense interior of the Conoocoo Archipelago.

Specific patterns and ornaments carry meaning known only to the tribe. An outsider would see a plain woven sash. An Old One would read a family lineage in the threadwork.

## The Featherless Ones

The Featherless Ones dress for the sky. Garments are lightweight, close-fitted, and layered for warmth at altitude — **pale blues, whites, silvers, and storm grey**. Feathers, ironically, feature prominently as decoration — gifted by their monster partners, never taken. A Featherless One's feather collection is a record of every bond they've held.

Wind-resistant wraps, flight harnesses integrated into clothing, and goggles or eye protection are common practical elements. Their clothing moves in the wind like it was designed to.

## The Wyvern People

The Wyvern People dress with the confidence of people who answer to dragons. Their attire is bold — **deep reds, burnished golds, and charcoal black** — and incorporates dragon-derived materials: shed scales worked into armor or jewelry, claw fragments set into belt buckles, leather tanned from shed skin gifted by their dragon partners.

Draconic Kin often bear additional markings — scarification, tattoos, or painted symbols — that signify their chosen status. Dragonsworn wear functional armor styled after the dragon they serve, making each set unique.

## Shared Traditions

Across all three tribes, certain principles hold:

- **Clothing tells a story.** Every significant garment or marking is earned, gifted, or inherited. Nothing is purely decorative.
- **Materials are local.** Tribal dress is made from what the land provides. Imported fabrics and synthetic materials are not used.
- **Markings matter.** Body paint, tattoos, scarification, and ritual markings are common across all tribes and carry deep personal and spiritual significance.

## Notes

- Tribal dress is not worn to impress outsiders. Most tribe members will wear simpler clothing when dealing with the outside world — if they deal with it at all.
- The mourning or exile rites described in other sections often involve the removal or destruction of tribal garments and markings. Losing your clothing is losing your identity.
- Do not copy tribal dress. The tribes consider it a profound disrespect, and the factions that interact with them know better than to test it.
