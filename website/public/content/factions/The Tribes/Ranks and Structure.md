# Ranks and Structure

> We do not have ranks. We have roles. They are not the same thing.

## Overview

Each tribe governs itself differently, but all share a common principle: roles exist to serve the tribe, not the individual. There are no promotions. There is no ambition. You are what the tribe needs you to be, and that is considered an honor, not a limitation.

## The Old Ones

The Old Ones are governed by silence as much as speech. Their structure is the least understood by outsiders.

- **The Unseen** — The tribal council. They are called Unseen because outsiders never meet them and members rarely speak of them. The Unseen make decisions for the tribe through means that are not shared.
- **The Hands** — The people who carry out the will of the Unseen. Guides, guardians, and caretakers who manage the tribe's daily life and serve as the only point of contact for outsiders.
- **The Roots** — Everyone else. Not a lesser role — the Roots *are* the tribe. Farmers, crafters, healers, and hunters who maintain the Old Ones' way of life.

## The Featherless Ones

A nomadic people organized around movement and the sky.

- **Windcaller** — The tribe's leader, chosen through a rite involving the monsters of the air. The Windcaller speaks for the tribe and decides when and where they move.
- **Skyborn** — Elite hunters and scouts who range ahead of the tribe, mapping safe passages through the Sky Isles and monitoring threats. Deeply bonded with flying monsters.
- **Keepers of the Roost** — Those who tend to the tribe's monsters, children, and elderly. Considered the most important role — without them, the tribe dies within a generation.
- **Feathered Kin** — All other members of the tribe. The name is deliberate — the Featherless Ones are called that by outsiders. Among themselves, they are all Kin.

## The Wyvern People

A proud, dragon-revering people with the most rigid structure of the three.

- **Draconic Kin** — Individuals chosen directly by a dragon. Draconic Kin lead the tribe and serve as intermediaries between their people and the dragons they worship. They are rare — usually no more than a handful in any generation.
- **Dragonsworn** — Warriors and protectors who have pledged themselves to a specific dragon or Draconic Kin. They form the tribe's fighting force and are responsible for defending the tribe's territory on the Sky Isles.
- **Hearthkeepers** — The backbone of Wyvern society. Crafters, healers, historians, and caretakers who maintain the tribe's settlements and oral traditions.
- **The Unnamed** — Children and newcomers who have not yet been acknowledged by a dragon or assigned a role. The Unnamed are not disrespected — they are simply waiting. The dragons will decide when they're ready.

## The Envoy (All Tribes)

The tribes do not send an Envoy to the regional leadership council. They do not recognize it. On the rare occasions when communication between the tribes and the outside world is necessary, a single representative — different each time, chosen by whatever internal process the tribe uses — will appear, say what needs saying, and leave.

This is not diplomacy. It is a statement delivered in person because the tribes do not trust written words.

## Notes

- The three tribes do not share a unified leadership or structure. They are separate peoples with separate customs who happen to share a commitment to isolation.
- Roles within any tribe are fluid over a lifetime. A Skyborn who is injured may become a Keeper of the Roost. A Hearthkeeper who earns a dragon's attention may become Dragonsworn. The tribe needs what it needs.
- Outsiders who attempt to map tribal structures onto familiar hierarchies will get it wrong every time. The tribes do not think in terms of power. They think in terms of duty.
