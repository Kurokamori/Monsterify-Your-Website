## The Old Ones — Conoocoo Archipelago

The Old Ones inhabit the deep interior of the Conoocoo Archipelago, primarily within and around the Primordial Jungle. Their settlements are not on any map produced by outsiders, and the few travelers who have ventured deep enough to find them report structures so integrated with the jungle that they're nearly invisible until you're standing inside one.

What is known: the Old Ones maintain villages throughout the jungle and hold certain sites — likely including the Time Temple and areas within Dinosaur Valley — as sacred. The full extent of their territory is unknown, because the Old Ones have no interest in telling anyone.

## The Featherless Ones — Sky Isles

The Featherless Ones are nomadic, moving between the floating islands of the Sky Isles in patterns dictated by wind, season, and tradition. They do not build permanent settlements in the way outsiders understand the term — their camps are assembled and disassembled as they travel.

They are most frequently sighted in and around Aurora Heights and the Nimbus Capital's outer reaches, though they range across the entire Sky Isles. The Wind Gardens and the areas around the Celestial Shrine are believed to hold spiritual significance for them.

## The Wyvern People — Sky Isles, Draconic Abyss

The Wyvern People are the most geographically fixed of the three tribes. Their primary settlement is Wyrmclaw Village in the Draconic Abyss — a territory so dangerous that its inaccessibility serves as a natural fortress. The Bone Citadel and the Dragon Graveyard are central to their culture, and the Apex Throne is believed to be their most sacred site.

The Wyvern People also maintain smaller encampments across the Sky Isles, though these are less permanent and more defensive in nature — watchtowers and patrol points rather than homes.

## Other Tribes

Smaller tribes exist elsewhere on the archipelago. Their locations, numbers, and customs are largely unknown. The three major tribes do not speak for them and do not share information about them.

## Notes

- None of these locations are open to outsiders without explicit invitation. Arriving uninvited is not dangerous because the tribes are violent — it's dangerous because the territories themselves are. The tribes survive there. You probably won't.
- The ongoing conflict between the Featherless Ones and the Wyvern People means the Sky Isles have contested zones where both tribes patrol. Outsiders caught between them will not be treated as neutral parties.
