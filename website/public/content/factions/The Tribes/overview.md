# The Tribes

Mysterious and fiercely independent, the Tribes guard their customs, rituals, and secrets from the outside world. Three major tribes — the Old Ones of the Conoocoo Archipelago, the Featherless Ones, and the Wyvern People of the Sky Isles — maintain their isolation as a deliberate path to preservation, intervening only when outsiders threaten the balance of their islands.
