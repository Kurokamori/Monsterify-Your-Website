# Allies and Enemies

# Overview

The Tribes do not seek allies. They do not negotiate treaties. What they have are relationships forged across generations — bonds of mutual respect with those who have proven themselves worthy of trust, and firm, unyielding hostility toward those who have proven they cannot be trusted near tribal lands, tribal people, or tribal secrets.

# Allies

## Rangers

Rangers earned tribal respect the hard way — by showing up, doing their jobs, and leaving without taking anything that wasn't theirs. Rangers protect the wilds that border tribal territory, and the Tribes appreciate that buffer. Ranger patrols near tribal lands are tolerated, sometimes even assisted, because the Tribes recognize that Rangers serve the same land they do.

## Spirit Keepers

The oldest bond. Keepers and Tribes share sacred knowledge, protect the same sites, and speak a spiritual language that the modern world has largely forgotten. When the Tribes need counsel on matters beyond the physical, they turn to the Keepers. When the Keepers need grounding in tradition older than their own, they turn to the Tribes. It is a partnership beyond politics.

## Ranchers

The Ranchers have been good neighbors for as long as anyone can remember. They respect boundaries, don't ask prying questions, and treat the land with a care the Tribes recognize as genuine. Trade between tribal communities and nearby ranches is quiet, practical, and has never once required a contract. When the Tribes need supplies from the outside world, Ranchers are the ones they trust to provide them.

## Tamers

Tamers approach the world with a gentleness the Tribes find rare among outsiders. They befriend monsters rather than dominate them, they respect places they don't understand, and they've never once tried to document or publish tribal customs. Some Tamers have been welcomed into tribal communities as guests — a distinction very few outsiders ever earn.

# Enemies

## Project Obsidian

Obsidian has attempted to access tribal lands for specimen collection. Multiple times. The Tribes have responded with escalating force. Obsidian's treatment of monsters as raw material, their disregard for sacred sites, and their willingness to operate covertly in tribal territory has earned them the deepest hostility the Tribes can muster. Obsidian operatives found in tribal lands are removed. The Tribes do not elaborate on what "removed" means.

# Neutral

## Digital Dawn

Dawn's technology-first worldview and their interest in "energy signatures" found on tribal lands puts them squarely on the Tribes' bad side. Dawn researchers have been turned away from tribal borders, and those who tried alternate routes found the Tribes were already waiting. The Tribes see Dawn as another flavor of outsider arrogance — people who believe their tools give them the right to go anywhere.

## Professor Koa's Lab

The Lab's hunger for knowledge has made them careless with tribal boundaries. Researchers have pushed too far, asked too many questions, and treated tribal lands as unexplored datasets rather than sovereign territory. The Tribes have said no — to surveys, to expeditions, to "just a quick sample." The Lab's persistence has turned what could have been neutral distance into active resentment.

## Nyakuza

Pirates treat the world as theirs to explore, and tribal waters and ruins are no exception. The Nyakuza's curiosity-driven trespassing into tribal territory has created genuine hostility. The Tribes don't care about Nyakuza charm or Nyakuza gold — they care that their sacred places are being treated as treasure maps. Nyakuza vessels near tribal waters are warned once. There is no second warning.

## League

The League has the good sense to leave the Tribes alone. League authority doesn't extend into tribal territory, and the Tribes don't challenge League governance elsewhere. It's an old understanding that both sides honor without discussion. The League occasionally sends diplomatic envoys. The Tribes occasionally receive them. Nothing ever changes, and that's the point.

## Twilight Order

The Order's spiritual interests occasionally overlap with tribal sacred sites, but the Order has been respectful enough to ask before approaching — a courtesy the Tribes acknowledge even when the answer is no. The relationship is watchful but not hostile. The Tribes see the Order as outsiders who at least understand that some things are sacred, even if their interpretation of the sacred is... different.
