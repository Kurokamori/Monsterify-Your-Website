## Overview

No one knows much about the tribes, and this is no accident.

The tribes as a whole are a mysterious lot, with strong connections to the old world. They are seldom seen outside of their own lands, and even then, only to those they trust. That is, also, all that can be said about the tribes as a monolith.

There are three major tribes in the region, with smaller ones peppered throughout the island. The three major tribes are as follows.

### The Old Ones
The Old Ones are not called that by their own, and yet no one knows what it is they call themselves. They are an ancient people, living in the heart of the Conoocoo Archipelago. They are a peaceful people, living in harmony with the land and the monsters that call it home.

They are also a people of many secrets. There is much of the Conoocoo Archipelago that is not known or understood. 

While the Old Ones will tolerate an outsider, they will ensure they only leave with what they came with, both material and intelectual.


### The Featherless Ones
A nomadic people, the Featherless Ones are a mysterious lot. They are a people of the air, living among the clouds on the Sky Isles. They are a people of few words, and fewer emotions. They are a people of action, and of tradition.

They revere the monsters of the air, and see them as equals. They believe that they are descended from these monsters, and that they are destined to live among them.

The Featherless Ones also have a strong hatred for the Wyvern People. The two tribes have been locked in a seething conflict for as long as anyone can remember.


### The Wyvern People
The Wyvern People are a proud people, living on the Sky Isles. They are a people of the land, and of the dragons that call it home. They believe that they are the chosen people of the dragons, and that they are destined to rule the Isles.

They are a people of honor, and of tradition. They believe that the dragons are their gods, and that they are their prophets. Among them are the "Draconic Kin" people expressly chosen by dragons. They are a rare few, and are often the leaders of the Wyvern People.

The Wyvern People also have a strong hatred for the Featherless Ones. The two tribes have been locked in a seething conflict for as long as anyone can remember.

## Values and Beliefs

Though each tribe may have their own values to an extent, certain things are true of all tribes.

- Isolation is the only guaranteed path to preservation.

- Blood is thicker than water.

- Customs, rituals, traditions are not to be shared with the people of the outside.

- Neutrality is not passivity; it is a deliberate and carefully maintained position.

## Overall Goal(s)

- Maintain the status quo of their tribes. Left alone by the outside world, left to live in their own ways, the tribes are content.

- Guard whatever each tribe guards.

- Intervene only when something directly threatens the balance of their islands. Only when their people, customs, traditions would be hurt by the actions of the outside world.
