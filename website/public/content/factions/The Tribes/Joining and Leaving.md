# Joining and Leaving

> You were not born of us. That is not a door. It is a wall.

## Joining

### The Hard Truth

You almost certainly cannot join a tribe. This is not a challenge to overcome or a rule to negotiate around. The tribes are not factions that recruit. They are peoples — bound by blood, tradition, and a history that predates every other group on the islands. Outsiders are not members-in-waiting. They are outsiders.

That said, "almost certainly" is not "never."

### Paths In (Rare)

#### Blood Right

If you have tribal ancestry — even distant — you may have a claim. Each tribe handles this differently:

- **The Old Ones** will assess you through means they do not explain to outsiders. If they accept your claim, you will undergo a period of integration that may last years. You will learn their ways, their language, and their silence. You will not be treated as an equal until you have earned it, and the Old Ones decide what "earned" means.

- **The Featherless Ones** require proof of lineage through their oral histories. If an elder recognizes your bloodline, you may be taken in — but you will begin at the bottom, regardless of your age or accomplishments outside the tribe.

- **The Wyvern People** require the acknowledgment of a dragon. Not a Wyvern People elder. A dragon. If a dragon recognizes something in you, the tribe will accept what the dragon accepts. This is as rare as it sounds.

#### Life Debt

If a tribe owes you — truly owes you, not a favor but a debt of survival — they may offer you a place among them. This is not asked for. It is given. Requesting it would void it. A life debt adoption places you within the tribe but outside its bloodlines. You will never be an elder. Your children, raised within the tribe, may be.

#### Exceptional Circumstance

In times of great crisis, the tribes have been known to accept outsiders who proved themselves indispensable to the tribe's survival. These cases are so rare they are counted in single digits across living memory. Each one is a story the tribe tells — not with pride, but with the solemnity of an exception they hope never to repeat.

### What You Get

- A people. Not a faction, not a network — a people who will claim you as their own in the deepest sense the word allows.
- Knowledge of the islands that no other faction possesses — the old paths, the hidden places, the stories written in stone.
- The protection of a community that has survived by being invisible and intends to continue doing so.

## Leaving

### The Weight of It

Leaving a tribe is not like leaving a faction. There is no form. No handshake. No "we understand."

To leave is to sever yourself from your people, your history, and — in the eyes of the tribe — your identity. The tribes do not hate those who leave. They grieve them. In some traditions, a departure is marked with a mourning rite, as though the person has died.

### Voluntary Departure

If you choose to leave, you must declare it before the tribe's elders. The specific ritual varies:

- **The Old Ones** will simply watch you go. They will not speak to you as you leave, and they will not speak of you after. Your name is removed from their oral histories. To them, you were never there.

- **The Featherless Ones** hold a sky burial for the departed — not of a body, but of the person's belongings and tribal markings. What was theirs in the tribe stays with the tribe. They leave with nothing but what they carried before they were claimed.

- **The Wyvern People** require you to face the dragon that acknowledged you (if applicable) and declare your departure to it directly. The dragon's response determines how the tribe remembers you. Some are released with honor. Others are not.

In all cases, the departed are expected never to reveal tribal secrets, sacred sites, or internal practices. This is not enforced through threats. It is enforced through the understanding that doing so would prove the tribe was right to let you go.

### Involuntary Exile

The tribes exile members for:

- **Revealing tribal secrets to outsiders.** The most severe offense. Exiled members are stripped of all tribal identity and cast out with a mark that signals to other tribes that this person is not to be trusted. The specific mark varies by tribe but is universally understood.
- **Betraying the tribe to an outside faction.** Allying with the League, the Order, or any other group against your own people. The exile is immediate and permanent.
- **Violating sacred law.** Each tribe has its own sacred laws. Violating them is handled internally, and the specifics are never shared with outsiders.

Exile from a tribe is permanent. There is no appeal. There is no return.

### Returning After Leaving

Those who left voluntarily exist in a gray space. They are not welcomed, but they are not forbidden. If a departed member returns and asks to be taken back, it falls to the elders to decide — and the decision is final. In practice, returns are almost unheard of. The mourning rite is not easily undone.

Those who were exiled do not return. The mark they carry ensures that even tribes who were not their own will turn them away.

## Notes

- The tribes do not recognize the concept of "dual faction membership." You are of the tribe, or you are not. There is no middle ground.
- Outsiders who have lived among a tribe temporarily — as guests, healers, or traders — are not considered members regardless of duration. Guest-right and membership are entirely separate things.
