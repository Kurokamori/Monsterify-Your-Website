# Part 1 - A Fated Mystery

The days grow longer once again as the earth moves closer to the sun, winter’s abandonment inches closer, but before its farewell, a ball to say goodbye, Valentine's Day festivities approach again.

A ball! Yes indeed. What a stellar idea.

A ball is being held nearby. Somehow near for all. Where you can come and dance away, your memories of frigid nights. All the best will be in attendance, so why would you dare to miss it?

Trainers, tamers, even ne'er-do-wells flock to this event – love is truly in the air.


## Prompt
**Prompt 1**
Design your character's attire for the ball, whatever it is they'd wear to such an event.

**Prompt 2**
Write or Draw your trainer arriving at the event and enjoying the festivities. 

– and or –

If this trainer is the sort to have someone to attend with (or to meet up with there), however, something is amiss. If they arrived together, they were separated, however briefly, regardless of the circumstances. When reunited, there is something ever so slightly off. It may not be bad, and it’s very likely the trainer will not notice. But all… is not as it seems.

– and  or –

If this trainer is not the sort to have anyone to be attending with, by odd happenstance, a wonderful person appears that they just seem to vibe with. The jokes are great, the conversation even better, it’s perfect.
