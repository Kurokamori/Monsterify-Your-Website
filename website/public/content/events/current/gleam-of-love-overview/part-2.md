# Part 2 - The Threads of Tales Unravel

# Part 2
The ball is going swimmingly! The festivities are at an all-time high— but something feels… just a little bit off. Whether you arrived with someone, met up with a loved one at the dance, or have made entirely new friends tonight, something doesn't sit right. Every answer too perfect. Every movement too precise. Like a portrait painted just slightly too beautiful to be real.
And then…
One by one.
They begin to act rather strange. Snide comments curling off their tongue like smoke. Gestures that feel hollow, somehow. It seems suddenly like they're trying to start a fight… or that they hate you… or something else entirely. Your perfect partner for the ball has become something out of a waking dream— and not the pleasant kind.
At first you respond in kind, retaliate, or simply take it on the chin.

All partners and companions have been replaced by illusions. These phantoms hunger not for cruelty, but for spectacle. They may conjure a blazing argument, shatter a relationship in front of prying eyes, or drop to one knee with a dramatic proposal. It is not the trainer's heart they wish to wound. It is their emotions they wish to pull like strings— bright, enormous, and utterly on display.

## Prompts:
**Prompt 1 :** Write or Draw the perfect ball moment, before it went wrong, when the partner was so perfectly in sync and everything was divine.

**Prompt 2 :** Write or Draw the fallout (be it positive or negative) what does your trainer’s partner(s) say or do to cause a big stir? Does the trainer tolerate it? Fight back? Notice right away that something is wrong? Or does it take a while for them to piece together that things are not quite as they seem?

Both prompts have the same rewards : 1 Love Velvet Cake, 1 Random Item (berry), 400 coins, 5 levels
