# Adoption Center (Monthly Adopts)

Welcome to the Adoption Center\! Come in, come in, there’s a monster for everyone and this is where the best part is done. It’s time to choose your newest friend, your pal, your companion for life, your little fuzzywuzzykins buddy (no, not that one) that you’ll love till the day the light drains from your eyes. Go on, take a look around, but don’t touch\! We don’t insure fingers here for a reason.

## Monthly Adopts:

Don’t forget, if you have one of our Daycare Daypasses, you’re welcome to adopt any monster in this lovely little lineup…or the last one…or the one before that…or really any, these lil guys ain’t going anywhere otherwise. Just don’t forget to take a picture so we can monetize — I mean share the moment with you two\!

## Rules:

At the start of each month, a new set of 10 random monsters are rolled and added to the monthly adopts list.  
You can adopt one per daycare daypass and can adopt multiple in one image, just submit the link to the image multiple times.  
Previous months’ adopts are still adoptable, there is no time limit.

## Adoption Artwork:

### Requirements:  
Fullbody of at least one of the trainer's Monsters and/or Halfbody of trainer.  
At least inked with flat color or equivalent.  
Be creative\! Branch out\! You don’t just have to do a first meeting, you are welcome to do trainers bonding with their new monsters, the first time the existing mons meet their new sibling, whatever floats your goat.  
Also, feel free to make it more complex, you will be compensated accordingly\!

You got your new friend? Well, we’ll be sad to see ‘em go. Come back and visit, ya hear? It’s good to see their little smiles grow year to year.
