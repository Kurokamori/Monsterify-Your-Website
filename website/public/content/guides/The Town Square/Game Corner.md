# Pomodoro Game Corner

Pick the time, pick the activity, and lock in whether you have a tomato or not\!

Spend the full time working diligently with no distractions, and when time is up, you’ll get to roll for a fun reward. Perhaps you’ll get a crappy item, maybe just the item you needed, or even a monster. If you’re particularly lucky, you might just find a legendary where you least expect it.
