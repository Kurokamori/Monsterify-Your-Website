# About Permanent Prompts
(Prompts work but I have to still add them to the database, so please bare with me, not all of these are in the game quite yet.)

Within the game you have the option to submit permanent prompt artwork, sometimes once per prompt, sometimes many times per prompt. Each prompt has unique challenges and rewards.
<br> There are the following types of permanent prompts:

- General Prompts
- Progression Prompts
- Special Prompts
- Monthly Prompts
- Event Prompts

Each type of prompt is unique in their own way, and may have unique art requirements.

Bellow is a more detailed look at each type of prompt.

## General Prompts
General prompts are prompts that are always available. They are not tied to any specific event or progression, though some may encourage you to display your trainers or mons in new environments or situations, but at its core, general prompts are prompts with simple rewards (like meager items or single mon rolls) that give you jumping off points for what to draw, especially as you discover what items the different prompts give.
<br>General Prompts are also the loosest, basically if you can make a case for an artwork applying to a given general prompt, and it took you more than 5 minutes to create you're good to submit it and claim your pittances.

## Progression Prompts
Progression prompts are prompts more directly tied to and influenced by trainer progression, these are prompts that show off milestones of the trainer's journey and growth, and should be unique to their experiences. Some are one time completion, some can be done multiple times.

## Special Prompts

## Monthly Prompts

## Event Prompts
