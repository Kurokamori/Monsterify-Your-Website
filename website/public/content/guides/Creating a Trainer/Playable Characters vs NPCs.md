# PCs vs NPCs
You are welcome to create both Playable and Non-Playable characters, but there are some key differences between the two types of characters.

There are no limits for how many characters of either sort that you create. While you are the sole owner of your PC (playable character) an NPC becomes public property and anyone can play with or use the NPC.
