# Abilities and Types of Alters / Halfwilds

Alters are in many ways just like humans, except with the odd hapenstance of their DNA crossing with the of one or many monsters. For the most part they remain unchanged, however most inherit some change to their appearance and even abilities and elemental atunement due to this DNA mutation.

No one is exactly certain how it happens, so sometimes it is passed down through the family, like any genetic trait, while other times it appears out of nowhere. One thing that is know for sure, is that it is unusually likely to occur on the Conoco and Conoocoo Archipelagos.

## Abilties
(From Pokemon, but not limited to Alters with specifically pokemon traits)

Alters may inherit an 'ability' from their monster DNA. This ability can be anything, but is often something that is related to the monster in some way. For example, an alter with a fire type might have the ability 'Blaze', which would grant them a small amount of fire damage to their attacks. Or an alter with Cofigrigus genetics may have the Mummy ability. There's no set in stone limit for what ability what alters have, but they can only ever have one.

You can also be a bit loose with the interpretation of abilities effects as many of them are very battle centric so it may not always perfectly translate to the 'ability' of a trainer.

Some examples :
Anger Point -> "Maxes Attack after taking a critical hit." -> "If my character is angered through combat, they're an exceptionally good fighter, but they're not able to deal the first blow."

Gooey -> "Contact with the Pokémon lowers the attacker's Speed stat." -> "My character is notably charistmatic, but others don't notice until my character makes physical contact with them."

Of course, some are pretty intuitive;

Telepathy -> "Anticipates an ally's attack and dodges it." -> Able to somewhat read the minds of others/predict their intentions.

Just make sure to not do anything to "god mode"


## Types
Alters can have up to 6 types. These are the Pokemon 18 types, but once again, it is not limited to Alters with pokemon monsters in their DNA.

Each type that an alter has, gives them atunement to that element in some way, but what that may look like varies from alter to alter. Bellow is a chart of ideas for each type, but it is neither all inclusive, nor does it mean an Alter of that type necissarily has al the abilities listed, it's just a starting point.

### Normal
Versatile and unassuming. Steady, adaptable, and hard to rattle.
Quick learners of everyday standard skills.
Naturally somewhat resistant to common ailments and simple tiredness.
Socially flexible and often pleasant.
Not notably powerful, and rare to excell in any one thing.


### Fire
Driven, passionate, hard to 'smother'. Their momentum is hard to stop, it's explosive and often inspiring to those around them. They have a high heat tolerance, some are even difficult to burn at all. Often have a higher body temperatue -- some may even be able to subtly heat their hands. They excell at short bursts, and often make incredible sprinters. More irritable than others.

### Water
Calm, perceptive, never too much. Exceptional swimmers, strong breath control, and an above average ability to hold their breath. Quick to recover, and rarely if ever get common colds. Intuitive sense for nagotiation, politics, and the 'flow of conversation'. However they often struggle to be in the sun or hot and dry cliamtes.

### Electric
Fast eyes, fast hands, fast mind. Electric types are well, electrified. They often struggle to sit still and always have somewhere to be or something to do. However, they're not all scatterbrained, many are able to focus this overdrive of energy into doing or creating great things. Electric type alters also often have lightning fast reflexes, and an easy time with technology. Unfortuantely those that are especially good at focusing this electric energy are also exceptional at burning out or depriving themselves of sleep. Overstimulation is also a massive problem for electric types.

### Grass
Patient, restorative, and sun-fed. Grass types are great with plants and animals, intuitive foragers, and natural caretakers; sunlight lifts their mood and endurance. They heal small scrapes a touch faster and bring a calming presence to tense rooms. In low light or sterile, windowless spaces they wilt—focus dips, energy thins—and pollutants or harsh chemicals hit them harder than most.

### Ice
Composed, conserving, and precise. Ice types tolerate cold with ease, keep a cool head in crises, and excel at fine, meticulous work over long periods. They can chill small objects with prolonged contact and think clearly when others panic. Heatwaves and sweltering rooms sap them fast, and they tend to “warm up” slowly both physically and socially.

### Fighting
Discipline in motion. Fighting types have excellent kinesthetic sense, efficient power, and clean technique; stance, timing, and leverage come naturally. They recover well from strain with proper rest and thrive on structured training. They can default to “solve by effort,” struggling with purely abstract problems, and overtraining or stubborn pride can lead to burnout.

### Poison
Survival chemistry and sharp instincts. Poison types resist venoms, spoiled food, and fumes; they’re quick to smell contamination and handle hazardous materials safely. Some can project subtle pheromonal cues to unsettle or soothe. Others may find them “prickly,” and strong perfumes or cleaners can trigger headaches; social stigma around their vibe can be a hurdle.

### Ground
Bedrock steady and practical. Ground types read terrain through their feet, sense vibrations, and keep balance on shifting surfaces; dust, sand, and pressure changes don’t faze them. They excel at building, digging, and load-bearing endurance. Swimming is a weak point, and once they pick a path they can be slow to pivot when the situation changes.

### Flying
Light, mobile, and spatially savvy. Flying types have superb balance and midair control, excel at parkour-like movement, and instinctively find drafts, escape routes, and high ground. They roll with falls and recover quickly from slips. Confinement, heavy gear, and cluttered rooms are draining; prolonged tight spaces can feel claustrophobic.

### Psychic
Intuitive, empathic, and razor-focused when the noise dies down. Psychic types pick up surface intentions, anticipate turns in conversation, and use breathing/focus techniques to sharpen memory and manage pain. They can project calm to cooperative allies. Emotional “crowd noise” overwhelms them—leading to headaches, fatigue, or analysis paralysis—and they need regular quiet to recharge.

### Bug
Incremental excellence and teamwork. Bug types spot patterns, notice fine details, and build big results from many small, steady improvements; they’re resilient to routine bumps and thrive with clear schedules. They’re great scouts, trackers, and fixers who keep teams humming. Harsh lights, pesticides, and chaotic, shifting plans can throw them badly off rhythm.

### Rock
Enduring, protective, and dependable. Rock types have dense frames, strong collision tolerance, and a knack for reading load paths and weak points in stone or masonry. Emotionally, they’re slow to panic and hard to intimidate. They tend to be heavy and slower to accelerate, dislike deep water, and can get stiff without regular movement.

### Ghost
Liminal, subtle, and attuned to what lingers. Ghost types move without drawing notice, feel the “mood” of old places, and stay clear-headed in dark, quiet environments. They often run cool and ignore mild chills. Bright, noisy crowds drain them, and electronics around them sometimes misbehave; they need solitude to stay balanced.

### Dragon
Resilient power with a long arc. Dragon types resist environmental extremes, project a commanding presence, and develop strength that deepens dramatically over years. They hit hard once momentum builds. Early learning curves can be slow, and pride or stubbornness can make it hard to change course even when they should.

### Dark
Canny, timing-driven, and hard to fool. Dark types read hostile intent, excel at counters and feints, and keep their emotions guarded against manipulation. They navigate moral gray with clear-eyed pragmatism. Bright light and relentless cheer wear them down, and trust is earned slowly, not given.

### Steel
Tempered resolve—precise, durable, and steady. Steel types handle pressure, cuts, and temperature swings better than most; they have sure hands for micro-craft and an uncanny sense for metal and mechanisms. Once they set a routine, they can get rigid, and without maintenance—sleep, stretch, fuel—they “rust” into stiffness and fatigue.

### Fairy
Glamour and ward. Fairy types soothe tensions, nudge luck, and wield gentle presence with hard boundaries; minor glamours (voice, scent, shimmer) make them persuasive performers or diplomats. They shrug off curses, mind tricks, and emotional hexes. Cold iron and harsh cynicism bite, and overusing charm leaves them drained and dim for a while.
