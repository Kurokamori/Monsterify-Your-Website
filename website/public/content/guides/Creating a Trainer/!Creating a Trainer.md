# Creating a Trainer (Playable Species)

Welcome! This is your one-stop guide for making a playable Trainer. Creativity first, minimum gates, and vibes over min-maxing.

---

## Hard Rules (the only two)
- **Age:** Your Trainer must be **18+**.
- **Intelligence:** Your Trainer must be **at least human-level intelligent** (can reason, consent, and participate meaningfully).

Everything else is creative freedom.

## What Counts as a “Trainer”?
A Trainer is any sentient person who explores, battles, studies, crafts, heals, or otherwise participates in the world’s monster-filled life. They may be human, non-human, or anywhere in between.

### Fully Allowed Species Options
- **Human:** Classic, versatile, and fun. (Do it. We dare you.)
- **Anthros/Furries:** Based on **real animals** *or* **Monsters** (or both). Mix and match anatomy to taste.
- **Creature Variants:** Dragons, birds, snakes, bugs, fish, lizards, hooved folk—go wild.
- **Hybrids:** Combine lineages in any sensible way; specify how the biology works if it’s especially unusual.
- **Catfolk:** Based on the Felyne/Melynx from Monster Hunter Stories. Mix and match anatomy to taste.

> If your design is extreme (very large wings, aquatic lungs, etc.), add one or two sentences on **how they function day-to-day** so other players can interact with them easily.

## Alters / Halfwilds (Optional)
“Alters” (aka **Halfwilds**) are an anomaly where human DNA **splices** with one or more **Monster** species. The result is a person with **visible traits** (horns, scales, coloration) and **elemental attunements** that reflect those Monsters.

- **Looks:** Any mix of human and monster traits you like.
- **Attunements:** Choose any of the 18 elemental types. Each type grants **flavorful tendencies** (toughness, senses, tolerances) rather than hard “video game powers.”
- **Keep it grounded:** Pick **1–3 manifestations per type** and include a **tradeoff** (e.g., Fire resists heat but risks burnout; Water excels in humidity but struggles in arid heat).
- **Abilities and Moves:** Alters may have an ability that is related to their monster DNA, this ability can be anything, but is often something that is related to the monster in some way. The exact nature of the ability changes between alters and monsters, and some may be more literal than others. Some like 'Flash Fire' may make the character resistant or even mostly immune to fire damage, while others like 'Thick Skin' may make them resistant to physical damage. Alters cannot directly use moves, but some may be able to harness a brief amount of elemental power from their types. This allows them to perhaps create a small ball of fire, breath underwater for a short amount of time, etc. however, this does take a lot of energy for the alter so they likely will need to rest afterwords or might even be incompasitated for a while.

## Catfolk (Optional)
A bonus race option based on the Felyne/Melynx from Monster Hunter Stories.
Catfolk vary in size and shape, including the 'expierements' introduced in the Monster Hunter Stories franchise. 

- **Looks:** Any mix of Felyne/Melynx traits you like. Claws, tail, fur, eyes, and ears are all common. They have a less 'defined' body shape compared to humans.
- **Attunements:** Catfolks can be used for bases for Alters, or they can be used on their own. As Alters they have all the same access to types as standard Alters, standard Catfolk may have an attunement to a type, especially the expierements.
- **Abilities and Moves:** Alters may have an ability that is related to their monster DNA, this ability can be anything, but is often something that is related to the monster in some way. The exact nature of the ability changes between alters and monsters, and some may be more literal than others. Some like 'Flash Fire' may make the character resistant or even mostly immune to fire damage, while others like 'Thick Skin' may make them resistant to physical damage. Alters cannot directly use moves, but some may be able to harness a brief amount of elemental power from their types. This allows them to perhaps create a small ball of fire, breath underwater for a short amount of time, etc. however, this does take a lot of energy for the alter so they likely will need to rest afterwords or might even be incompasitated for a while.

## Power & Balance Guidelines (Common Sense)
These aren’t extra rules—just advice to keep everyone having fun.

- **No god-moding:** If you give a strong edge, give a practical limit (environmental, stamina, focus, equipment, etc.).
- **Consent-first themes:** Mind control, body horror, or intense psychological effects require opt-in from scene partners.
- **Spotlight sharing:** Gear, summons, or familiars are great—just don’t let a whole army replace your character’s actual play.
- **Environment matters:** Note where your Trainer excels and where they struggle (desert vs. ocean, crowds vs. solitude, etc.).

---

## Gear, Roles, and Skills (Totally Up to You)
- **Gear:** From spears to scanners to sewing kits—carry what fits your concept.
- **Role Ideas:** Ranger, researcher, chef, smith, medic, courier, scholar, breeder, explorer, storyteller… or invent your own.
- **Companions:** Having Monster partners is normal; define your relationship style (mentor, equal partner, caretaker, contractor).

---

## Quick Build Steps
1. **Concept in one line:** “Desert courier who maps stormfronts,” “Gentle giant smith with Steel attunement,” etc.
2. **Species choice:** Human, Anthro/Variant, Hybrid, Halfwild, or Catfolk.
3. **Attunements (optional):** Pick types and **1–3 flavor manifestations** each, plus **tradeoffs**.
4. **Strengths & limits:** What do they do best? What trips them up?
5. **Hook(s):** A goal, a flaw, and a bond (ally, rival, promise, debt, or mystery).

---

## Example Snippets

**Human Linguist (No Attunement)**
- Calm, curious, keeps field notes; great with people, bad with heights.

**Bird-Folk Scout (Flying / Grass)**
- Parkour movement, reads wind and weather; wilts in windowless labs.

**Halfwild (Dragon / Fire)**
- Endures heat and cold, strong presence; slow learner at first, risks burnout.

---

## TL;DR
- **18+, human-level intelligence.**
- Any species form is valid: Human, Anthro, Hybrid, Halfwild, or Catfolk.
- Use elemental attunements as **flavor**, not hard powers.
- Give every strength a **reasonable limit**.
- Lead with personality and goals—the cool bits will follow.

Happy creating, Trainer. 🌟
