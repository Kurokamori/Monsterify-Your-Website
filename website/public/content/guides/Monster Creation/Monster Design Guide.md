# Monster Design Guide

So you got a creature! Now what?
Well it's time to design them of course!

### Embracing the Mix
With some exceptions, most of your rolls will be random mons generated from 1 - 3 species of Digimon, Pokemon, and/or Yokai possessing up to 5 types and an attribute. That can be a lot! <br> So make sure to focus on the fun of the fusions, and remember, just like with pokemon, not every element of a monster will be equally obvious. Not every electric type needs to be yellow and not every water type needs to be blue. <br> That being said, do keep in mind general themes of each type, and do your best to incorporate something from every element of your creature.
<br> Included in these guides is a non-exhaustive list of common themes for each type and attribute, to get you started, but in my mind, so long as you can make a meaningful connection between the elements of your monster, you're good to go!

<br> Furthermore, while not something you may want to use often as it is a cop-out in some sense, sometimes the personality, narrative, etc of a monster may be enough to connect it to its type. Fire type mon that doesn't have any red or fire but looks pissed off 100% of the time and picks fights with anything and everything? Yep that's a fire type.

#### Unless something truly egregious is submitted I will not be policing your monster designs.

It's simple, I don't have any interest in infringing on fun and creativity, and at the end of the day, that's what we're here for.
<br> If you want help, I will of course give you pointers on how I feel you could push the design towards a certain aspect, but if you want to do a bright yellow dark type, I'm not going to stop you.

## A Special Note on Legendaries and Mythicals
Legendaries and Mythicals are in the game, and are treated as special but not singularly unique. There is more than one Ho-oh, more than one Suicune, etc.
<br> There will be no specific uniqueness to legendaries beyond how hard they are to get, especially as Digimon and Yokai each use entirely unique systems for their "legendary"

<br> There is one exception to this, and that is the digimon "Calumon" who will be awarded per trainer for completing a specific prompt and cannot be bred or traded, unless someone makes me an insnanely good argument for a trainer posessing more than one, each trainer can have a max of 1 Calumon.
