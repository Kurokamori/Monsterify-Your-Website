# The World as a Whole 

## Welcome to the world of Dusk and Dawn! 
The world of Dusk and Dawn is most directly based on the world of Pokemon, with similar trainer-monster relationships, and an overall similar world dynamic.

However! There are some key differences, most notably, ofcourse, the existence of multiple monster species. These monsters appear in this world much like they would if they where Pokemon, but each keeping a partial flare from their original lore.

Digimon are for example, still intrinsically linked to technology and are likely to appear in mre digital locations. Some even beleive there is a whole parallel "digital world".

Similarly, Yokai are still very connected to the spiritual world, and many believe that they come from a spiritual realm, and that they are the protectors of the natural world.

Different sects of people interact with these monsters in different ways, and believe different things about them. For more details see the Factions guides.

## You are Here
The game takes place in the Conoco Region, a group of islands in a far of region of the oceons. The region is made up of 3 main landmasses, Conoco Island, the Conoocoo Archipelago, and the Sky Isles. (Yes the landmass names are confusing, as was the intent of the people that once named them -- to mitigate this Conoocoo Archipelago is often just called 'the archipelago')

### Conoco Island
Conoco Island is the largest and most populated of the 3 landmasses. It is home to a vast variety of regions and areas, with cities, landmarks, and regions correlating to every type. If there's a biome or vibe you're looking for you're likely to find it here. From Nordic Tundras to Egyptian Swamps, there's people of every type, and places for every monster.

The island is home to 'Heartfall Commons', the capital of the region, where many of the factions have their headquarters, and where most of the major events of the region take place.

### The Archipelago
The Archipelago is a group of islands to the east of Conoco Island. These islands remain largely unexplored by the populous of Conoco Island, and as such are home to the oldest tribe of people in the region, as well as a dense jungle full of secrets yet to be named or understood.

### Sky Isles
The Sky Isles are a group of islands floating in the sky, accessible only by those who can fly, or by those who have found a way to reach them. These islands are home to a variety of airborne and celestial monsters, as well as two warring tribes, the Featherless Ones and the Wyvern People.
