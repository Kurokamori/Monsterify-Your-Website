# Submitting Lore Entries
Lore entries are short stories or snippets about a specific myth, legend, or happening in the world. I prefer these to feel more like a story than just a non-fiction entry, but either is acceptable.

These should build up the world, or a specific element of the world and the way that people live in it. As they are often myths and legends, they don't necessarily have to be "true" - just something believed to be by some people.
