# Sky Islands

> The Sky Isles are a group of islands floating in the sky, accessible only by those who can fly, or by those who have found a way to reach them. These islands are home to a variety of airborne and celestial monsters, as well as two warring tribes, the Featherless Ones and the Wyvern People.

The Sky Isles are essentially an entire archipelago that floats above the main Conoco Region. Some are connected by bridges or floating platforms, but most are not. Survival in the Sky Isles is difficult and relies on a close partnership with monsters that can fly. For most, the Isles are entirely inhospitable.


## The Tribes
One the Isles, there are two tribes of people, the Featherless Ones and the Wyvern People. These two tribes are bitter enemies, and have been for as long as anyone can remember. 

The Featherless Ones worship the creatures of the air, and believe that they are descended from them. They live in harmony with the monsters of the air, and see them as equals. The tribe itself is a matriarchy, with the eldest female of each clan being the leader. They live on the lower parts of the isles.

The Wyvern People worship dragons, and those of draconic persuasion. They believe that they are the chosen people of the dragons, and that they are destined to rule the Isles. They live on the upper parts of the isles, and believe themselves above not only the Featherless Ones, but all other lifeforms.

## Visitors
Visitors to the Sky Isles are rare, but not unheard of. Those that do visit are typically wield powerful monsters. The most common way to visit is to simply fly there, but there are also those that have found a way to reach the isles by other means. Generally both tribes are welcoming to those that wish to visit, but are quick to steer them away from any cultural landmarks. While both tribes tollerate the occasional visitor, they have no interest in the outside world, and would rather they not know about their ways.

Wyvern People are also quite welcoming to anyone who comes having tamed a strong dragon, and similarly, the Fetherless Ones, take rather kindly to those that come living in harmony with their air born monsters.
