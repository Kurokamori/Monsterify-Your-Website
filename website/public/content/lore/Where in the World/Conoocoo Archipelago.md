# Conoocoo Archipelago

> The Conoocoo Archipelago is a group of islands to the east of Conoco Island. These islands remain largely unexplored by the populous of Conoco Island, and as such are home to the oldest tribe of people in the region, as well as a dense jungle full of secrets yet to be named or understood.

While there is an entire archipelago, much of what's most interesting about the archipelago is found on the largest island, the one furthest from Conoco Island.

This lush island is home to the oldest tribe of people in the region, they have their own name, but those outside the tribe simply call them the Old Ones. These are people who have lived in harmony with the islands for a long time, and are very protective of it's mostly undiscovered jungles.

The island can be seen essentially as a set od concentric rings, the outer most edge of the island is the crystal beaches, a series of beaches with fine sand, calm monsters, and jagged crystals. But as you get deeper into the island, the next circle is simply dense forest, that grows denser as you approach the middle of the island. The middle itself, is a massive volcano, surrounded by an impassable jungle, that is said to be the literal heart of the island.

What exactly is in this jungle only the people of the island know. It's a carefully kept secret they're willing to go to death to protect.
