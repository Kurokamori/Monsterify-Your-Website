# Conoco Island

> Conoco Island is the largest and most populated of the 3 landmasses. It is home to a vast variety of regions and areas, with cities, landmarks, and regions correlating to every type. If there's a biome or vibe you're looking for you're likely to find it here. From Nordic Tundras to Egyptian Swamps, there's people of every type, and places for every monster.

Conoco Island has a large variety of locations, and I really suggest exploring the interactive map to find what you're looking for, but below are some notable locations.

## Heartfall Commons
The capital of the Conoco Region, Heartfall Commons is the political and economic center of Conoco Island. It is home to the League headquarters, the main train station, and the main airport. It is also home to the largest city on the island, and is the first place most visitors arrive.

### Heimdal City
Heimdal City is the largest city on Conoco Island, and is the first place most visitors arrive. It is a sprawling city with a unique blend of cultures, architectures, and people. If you're looking for almost anything or anyone, Heimdal City is a good place to start.

Notable Locations :
- League Headquarters
- Koa Laboratory
- Rangers Central Base


Under the nose of the vast authorities, evil teams lurk here too. Schemes and secrets dwell in the shadows of Heimdal City. Despite it's seemingly cozy exterior the different evils of this world still manage to find a way to cause trouble.

## Mictlan Hollows
A dark and foreboding jungle, far from the eyes of the Heartfall Commons, Mictlan Hollows is home to all things sinister and dark. Yokai and ghost type monsters of all sorts seem particularly drawn to this region. Mictlan Hollows is a dangerous place where evil organizations work tirelessly under the shrouds of night.

## Pirate's Bay
A hidden cove on the western edge of Conoco Island, Pirate's Bay is a lawless haven for rogues and outcasts. Here, the League's reach is short, and the only authority is the might of the pirates themselves. It is a place of danger and opportunity, where fortunes can be won and lost in a single stroke of luck. This bay is home to the infamous Nyakuza pirates, and is a popular spot for smugglers and thieves.
