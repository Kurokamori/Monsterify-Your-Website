- ## The Multiverse

    Not all characters are as they seem, some have appeared in this world from places not quite like ours.

    If you're porting characters over from another ARPG/Roleplay you can make them fallers and allow them to keep their original lore -- being suddenly transplanted into this world.

    There are also Ultra Beasts and ancient/future fallers, whcih are fallers from worlds quite different from ours.
