# Universe Crossers

There are universes quite like ours, and yet vastly different. The multiverse is expansive. And anything is possible.

These are characters from a multiverse that was crossed with the main one, and they’re now stuck in a world like theirs and yet different.

## Rules for Universe Crossers

The year can be no more than 50 years past or future, and in general the universe should be similar. But concepts like : landforms, countries, certain factions, monsters, all of that can be variable.

There are cannon multiverses, mostly for the convinience of the fact that a few of them are based on past ARPGs that characters are being ported from, but your characters don’t specifically have to be from one of the listed ones.   
If you want me to update this list with a universe you created, let me know, I just need a letter that hasn’t been taken, a name, and a description\!
