# The Canon Universes

## A! OG Crater
- A Pokémon world with "alters" - individuals of up to human × one monster
- Modern setting

## B! "Alternate Crater"
- Very similar to Crater, but with a few notable differences
- *(Note: This distinction represents pre-playable Nebula-ish and post-playable Nebula-ish periods. Don't stress about whether your characters are from A! or B! - they're similar enough that it doesn't matter much. This separation mainly exists for TK plot purposes.)*

## C! Future Crater
- The world of Crater ~30 years into the future

# D! Dusk and Dawn
- The main game world

## E! Eclipse Canon
- A Pokémon-exclusive world featuring "halfwilds" (humans × up to 3 Pokémon species and 6 types)
