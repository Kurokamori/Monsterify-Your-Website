# On Trainers

## What is a Trainer?
A trainer is any sentient person who explores, battles, studies, crafts, heals, or otherwise participates in the world’s monster-filled life. They may be human, non-human, or anywhere in between. While in the Pokemon world 'trainer' exclusively referred to people who have monsters for the purpose of battling in the league, in Dusk and Dawn, anyone who interacts with monsters in any dedicated capacity is a trainer.
