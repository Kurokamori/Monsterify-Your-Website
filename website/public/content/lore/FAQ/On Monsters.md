# On Monsters

## Can Monsters Talk?
Not at first, but monsters can learn to speak through circumstances such as being taught by another monsters, taught by their traiener, or learning it on their own. The permentant prompt for monsters learning to talk will allow a monster the ability to speak. How well they can speak is up to the player.

## How Intelegent are Monsters?
The exact intelegence of a monster is up to the player, and monsters vary greatly in intelegence. Generally monster's inteligence ranges from that of a gerble to that of a very young human. Try to be mindful that others may view their monsters while other players see them more as companions.

## Legendary and Mythical Monsters
Perhaps it was when everything went sideways, perhaps it was always the case, but the once rare and unique legendaries and mythicals of the Pokemon world are now far more common than they once where. Sure they're still not around every corner, but it seems that there are far more than one. Weirder still, they're now able to breed, so once one is acquired, more can be farmed.

## Digimon / Yokai / And other monsters
Digimon and Yokai each have a unique type of 'being' in their core lore. Digimon are, of course, Digital Lifeforms, and Yokai are spirits. 

In Dusk and Dawn, through manners entirely not understood, beings are able to fuse and co-exist between these types of lifeforms. A non-fused Digimon may be entirely a Digital Lifeform, but a fused Digimon might be partially digital, partially physical, or entirely one or the other. Similarly for Yokai.

The exact logic of these divides is not known, and seems to vary monster to monster.
