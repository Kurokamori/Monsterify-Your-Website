# On the World

## What is the World of Dusk and Dawn?
The world of Dusk and Dawn is a world much like that of Pokemon, but with multiple monster species. These monsters appear in this world much like they would if they where Pokemon, but each keeping a partial flare from their original lore.

## Where Did They Come From?
This world was not always inhabited by so many types of creatures. Once upon a time, only Pokemon roamed free. However, slowly, other species bled into this world, and seemingly with them, people that did not belong. Very few remember this however, and as a whole, people have seemingly forgotten that anything was weird at all. But a few select individuals, old enough to remember, or part of one of the few factions that has attempted to keep this truth alive, remain warry of this change.

## The Government
The governement of the Conoco Region is a loose confederation of the 3 main landmasses, with each landmass having its own government. The governments of the Archipelago and the Sky Isles are relatively simple, with a single ruler, but Conoco Island is home to a much more complex system -- ruled by the 'chairs' of each major legitimate faction (League, Rangers, Tamers, Breeders, Spirit Keepers, and a representative from each major tribe.)
