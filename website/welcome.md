## Welcome to Dusk and Dawn!
### The Art Based Creature Collector and Roleplaying Game!

### What Is Dusk and Dawn
Dusk and Dawn is an "ARPG" or Art Role Playing Game where you play the game through making art and roleplaying with other players. You have charactres ("Trainers") and each trainer has their own inventory and Monsters. These Monsters aren't just any monsters, they're unique creatures you design based on rolls. Monsters can be based on creatures from Pokemon, Digimon, Yokai Watch, Palworld, and Nexomon. Monsters can be fusions of up to 3 species, and have 1-5 types (pokemon types) as well as an 'attribute' (Digimon attributes)

But what's the point? Fun! 
You get to design your own characters and their creatures, and then send them off into the world to interact with other player's characters and creatures, or write stories about them all on your lonesome. However you choose to play, Dusk and Dawn is a medium for creativity and community.
### How Do I Get Started?

Getting Started can feel a bit overwhelming but follow these simple steps and you'll be rolling monsters in no time!

#### Step 1 : Create an Account at https://DuskAndDawn.net 

The majority of the game is played through the website, so you'll need an account to get started. Either use the built in 'register with discord' or feel free to ping me and I'll give you your "discord id" (no this is not your discord username) either way the website has to be connected to your discord account as that is how progress is saved.

#### Step 2 : Create Your Trainer

There's a few guides on the webiste to help get you started, check out [links]

Once you have your trainer planned out, hop over to the "Create Trainer" link (by clicking your name in the top left; it's in the dropdown)

This form has a TON of fields, but you only need to fill out the name, all this information will be available for you to edit later, so don't worry if you're not ready to fill out every minor detail of your trainer right away.

#### Step 3 : Your Starter Monsters

Once you submit your trainer form, you'll be redirected to a page to choose three monsters are your trainer's starters. Simply click the one you like most from each set of ten, choose their names, and hit 'next' to finish the selection.

Now you're ready to start your adventure!

From here you can start exploring the world, catching monsters, and building your team. You can also start working on your art and writing submissions to earn rewards and advance in the game.

### What Is There To Do?
There's a huge variety of activities to do in Dusk and Dawn.

#### You can submit art and writing for levels, points, and sometimes even monsters.
Click on your name in the top right and select 'process submissions' to get started.
Here there are a few options :
- Submit Art -- standard art submissions
- Submit Writing -- standard writing submissions
- Submit Monster References -- submit reference art of your monsters
- Submit Trainer References -- submit reference art of your trainer
- Submit Mega Image References -- submit reference art of your monster's mega evolution
- Submit Trainer Mega References -- submit reference art of your trainer's mega evolution
- Submit Prompt Submissions -- submit art or writing to complete prompts for special rewards

### You can hatch eggs for new monsters
Head to the town nursery to hatch eggs for new monsters. You can hatch random eggs, or use items to influence the outcome of the hatch.
You either need to make art of your trainer/monster tending to the egg to hatch it, or use an incubator to bypass this requirement.

### You can breed monsters together for unique offsprings
Got a monster you love and you want 100 more of? Spend a legacy leeway ticket to breed any two fully evolved (or in the case of digimon Champion and above) monsters to see what you get.

### Go on adventures alone or with friends
Spend a mission mandate to start a new adventure, these are roleplays that allow you to roll encounters for monsters, battles, or items.
They can be completely solo, together, letting the bot dm for you, or you can ping a mpd and ask them to DM a mission for you/ you and others if you want a more D&D esque expierence.

### Plus so much more!
Use berries and pastries to modify your monsters, visit the Witch's Hut to evolve your monsters, do fun drawing challenges or use the pomodoro timer to earn extra rewards, apraise antiques for silly rolls, and so much more!
