# The Beginnings - Part 1 - A Mysterious Letter's Arrival
2024-01-15 to 2024-02-15

*The ties that bind us are not always strong, but they're always present, pulling us, gently, towards our destiny.*

A letter has arrived for you, it has appeared, though it is unclear how. Its form remains unmarred by the usual warfield of couriers and delivery and yet it's not like someone handed it to you. It was just… there totally ordinary, and yet, totally weird.

Opening it however, offers no hints.

Simply your name.
And an address.

An expectation to arrive.

And scrawled, in oddly different handwriting, a date. <br>
*Today.* <br>
<br>
Do you go?

## Event Details

A letter has arrived for your trainer(s) summoning them to this location, at least in theory, though that doesn't mean it has necessarily made it to them. This letter is inviting them to an address in Central City. Those who would be able to will recognize this as the address of Professor Koa's Laboratory. It's a mysterious and sketchy summoning.

Does the trainer go? What do they do to prepare? 

Who would miss them if they never returned?

## Participation

This is the first part of the event 'The Beginnings'. The roleplay for the event will be set up to (hopefully) automatically calculate levels in the thread it's created in. Players will be rewarded with levels, and possibly bonuses, for participating in the roleplay. Not all trainers are required to participate.

## Prompts

Along with the roleplay, each part will come with art/writing prompts. These are meant to inspire creativity, and can be interpreted loosely. Remember to submit them both for levels as standard writing/art submissions and as prompt submissions for prompt specific rewards.

**Prompt 1:** What are the ties that bind your trainer? Who do they look to? Who do they trust and who do they not? Who do they look forward to seeing at the end of a long day, and who do they dread every interaction with? Each trainer has many ties that bind them, explore at least one.

**Prompt 2:** How does the trainer react the mysterious letter? Draw them reacting to it, be that throwing it away or prepare to head off to Central City or anything in between.
