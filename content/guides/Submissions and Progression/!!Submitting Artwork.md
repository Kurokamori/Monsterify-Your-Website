# Submitting Artwork
Submitting artwork is pretty easy, it's done entirely through the website with mostly automatic calculations.

To submit artwork, begin by logging in (if you're not already logged in) and then clicking your name to bring up the profile dropdown, from there select 'process submissions'.

Here there are 6 options :
### Submitting Writing
Fill out the form, add tags, upload your writing or paste it directly into the text box (add a cover image if you'd like) and then simply add who is getting the levels.

Writing levels are directly decided by word count, but you can split up the levels however you'd like.

### Submitting References (Trainer and Monster References + Trainer and Monster Mega References)
All References are pretty intuitive to submit. Select the type of reference you want to submit, and then simply upload the image and fill out the necissary information (which trainer + if it's a monster, the monster's name)

In most cases that's all it takes for you to be ready to submit. You can submit multiple references at once by selecting 'add reference' and in monster references you can select 'upload many' to upload a bunch of images at once.

In some rare cases there might be a reason to select 'custom level amount'.

In most cases references, regardless of the monster are worth 6 levels, and their trainer gets 200 coins. However, if your reference includes multiple drawings of the monster, or the monster is many racoons in a trench coat (think Maushold or Falinks) you can select a custom level amount and the level you input is 6*# of monsters in the image.

### Submitting Prompts (Not Currently Available)
*(see permanent prompts for details once this is available)*

### Submitting Artwork
For all other artwork, you'll go to the 'submit art' card, where you're greeted with a form.

Fill out the name, description (optional), content type, tags (optional), and upload your file.

> A Note : For all images used in the game, I recomend keeping them under 1000 x 1000 so that the server can fetch them quickly. I don't know exactly what the upper limit is of the upload software, but if you're getting an "upload failed" error - chances are your image is too large.

Next declare the quality of the image, and the background type.

#### Image Quality
there are 5 options, and there's a little bit of give as to exactly what each option requires. Use your best judgement based on your art and the effort you put into the artwork.

- Sketch: A rough, preliminary drawing with little detail.
- Sketch Set: A set of rough, preliminary drawings with little detail.
- Line Art: A detailed drawing with clear lines and no color.
- Rendered: A detailed drawing with clear lines and color, and possibly simple shading.
- Polished: A highly detailed drawing with clear lines, color, and complex shading. (Or no lines at all in the case of paintings)

#### Background Type
You'll notice that you can add multiple backgrounds, this is for situations like comics where there may be multiple backgrounds in one image.

For each background, you'll need to select the type of background it is.

- Simple: A plain background with little detail. (Some grass, maybe a tree, etc)
- Complex: A detailed background with many elements. (A fleshed out location, a detailed cityscape, a forest with layers of trees, etc.)

> Additional Difficulty: If you feel like your image is particularly difficult to draw, you can select the 'uniquely difficult' option. This will add 3 levels to the image. This is for circumstances where you went above and beyond the call of duty to create something truly unique and difficult for you. This is something that was especially dificult for YOU. What that may look like is different person to person. Please don't abuse this.

From here, you're now going to add in each entity that is in your image, list all trainers, monsters, and non-player characters that you have drawn.

#### Trainers :
Select the trainer from the dropdown
- Select how much of the trainer is visible 

  - Bust : Head and Shoulders, maybe a Hand.
  - Half Body : Roughly half the body, torso and up, maybe the slightest bit of leg.
  - Full Body : The entire body is visible - or atleast 90% of it. I don't need to specifically see feet to head, but no major part of the body should be omitted.

There's also a number, this is the number of times this trainer appears in the image. So if you for example have drawn a comic where you drew the trainer 4 times, this lets you easily multiply the levels they get by 4.

#### Monsters :
For monsters you must first select the trainer it belongs to, and then select the monster.
- Then : select how much of the monster is visible 
  - Head : Just the head is visible
  - Bust : Head and Shoulders, maybe a Hand.
  - Half Body : Roughly half the body, torso and up, maybe the slightest bit of leg.
  - Full Body : The entire body is visible - or atleast 90% of it. I don't need to specifically see feet to head, but no major part of the body should be omitted.

Monsters also have the same number to dictate how many times they appear in the image.

You'll also notice a 'Complexity Bonus' this is unique to monsters, and is a bonus for drawing more complex monsters.
(We can all agree, drawing a Swablu is far easier than drawing a Tyranitar)


#### Complexity Bonuses
Select the complexity bonus that best describes the monster you have drawn. Use whichever species in a fusion would get the highest bonus.

For example a Pichu (+0) / Tyranitar (+3) fusion would get a +3 complexity bonus

#### Pokémon / Nexomon
- Base Stage: +0 levels
- First Evolution: +1 level
- Final Stage: +2 levels
- Second Evolution: +3 levels
- Doesn't Evolve: +3 levels

#### Digimon
- Baby/Fresh: +0 levels
- Rookie: +1 level
- Champion: +3 levels
- Above Champion: +5 levels

#### Other
- Palmon: +2 levels
- Yokai: +2 levels


#### Non-Player Characters (trainers and monsters)
If you've drawn a non-player character (npc) you can add them here.

Any person or monster that doesn't belong to a player can be added.

Name is optional, but there if you need to keep track of who you have/have not added.

Size is the same as for trainers and monsters. (Bust/Half Body/Full Body)

Complexity, is the same as above. People/Alters receive a +3 bonus for complexity.


Once you've done that, you're ready to hit submit!

### Level 100 Monsters and Gift Art
#### Level 100 Monsters
If you've submitted art featuring a monster at level 100 or a monster that would cross level 100 with the levels earned in the artwork, you'll be shown the 'level reallocation page'. Here it will tell you how many levels you have (1 level for every 2 over level 100) and you can choose which of your trainers/monsters you want that to go to.

#### Gift Art
If you've submitted art that is not for any specific trainer or monster, you'll be shown the 'gift rewards page'.

Here you'll see the rewards you received for all gift levels. (A gift level is any level that went to someone that doesn't belong to you. All other player's monsters/trainers as well as NPCs)

You will earn levels (1 level for every 2 you gave) as well as items and even monsters. Select who you want everything to go to and then proceed to the final screen.

#### The Recap

Lastly, you'll see a recap of levels earned as well as :
- Mission Progress if you have monsters on a mission
- Garden Points Earned
- Boss Damage done to the Monthly Boss
