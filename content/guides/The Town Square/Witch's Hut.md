# Witch’s Hut (Evolution)

Do I hear a customer? OOOOOOOOOOOO I DO\! Delightful, delightful\! Come closer and tell Seed all your heart’s desires. Here, wishes are merely a stone’s throw away from reality.

## Evolution:

Ah ah ah\! Mind you, you must aim that stone carefully. There are a few rules to the Witch’s Hut, so listen up.

## Requirements: 

An Evolution Artwork or Evolution Item  
Evolution Stone : If used on a mon of the same type, this skips the evolution art  
If used on a mon of a different type, it will add the type and also skips the evolution art  
If Void \- No type  
If Aurorus \- Random type

Bytes allow evolution of specific stages

Digital Repair Kits evolve monsters into any species. HOWEVER, this is a bug catching mechanic, so don’t use it  maliciously, please. If something isn’t working correctly, this should help.

## Process:

Select Trainer  
Select Monster  
If more than one species is eligible for evolution : Select Species  
Either Submit Artwork or Write Evolution Item Use (please capitalize and spell correctly or else you’ll confuse the poor bot)  
If more than one evolution option is available for the species, chose evolution option  
Evolved\!

Nyehehehehe, I told you\! Wish hard and aim well, young one, and you shall go farther than your wildest dreams.
