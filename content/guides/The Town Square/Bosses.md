# Bosses

## Premise:

A monthly boss for everyone to battle\! Let’s take ‘em down together, team\!

## Process:

Doing activities in the game can do damage to the boss.

## Victory:

Once the boss is defeated, everyone can claim rewards (hopefully, it’s been a bit buggy, so I may have to manually enter rewards)

Whoever did the most damage to the boss over the course of the “battle” will get a baby form of the boss.

Everyone else will get a secret “grunt” monster so long as they did damage at some point in the month.

At the start of the month a new boss will appear.
