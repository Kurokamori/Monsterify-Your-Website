# Creating a Trainer (Playable Species)

Welcome! This is your one-stop guide for making a playable Trainer. Creativity first, minimum gates, and vibes over min-maxing.

---

## Hard Rules (the only two)
- **Age:** Your Trainer must be **18+**.
- **Intelligence:** Your Trainer must be **at least human-level intelligent** (can reason, consent, and participate meaningfully).

Everything else is creative freedom.

## What Counts as a “Trainer”?
A Trainer is any sentient person who explores, battles, studies, crafts, heals, or otherwise participates in the world’s monster-filled life. They may be human, non-human, or anywhere in between.

### Fully Allowed Species Options
- **Human:** Classic, versatile, and fun. (Do it. We dare you.)
- **Anthros/Furries:** Based on **real animals** *or* **Monsters** (or both). Mix and match anatomy to taste.
- **Creature Variants:** Dragons, birds, snakes, bugs, fish, lizards, hooved folk—go wild.
- **Hybrids:** Combine lineages in any sensible way; specify how the biology works if it’s especially unusual.

> If your design is extreme (very large wings, aquatic lungs, etc.), add one or two sentences on **how they function day-to-day** so other players can interact with them easily.

## Alters / Halfwilds (Optional)
“Alters” (aka **Halfwilds**) are an anomaly where human DNA **splices** with one or more **Monster** species. The result is a person with **visible traits** (horns, scales, coloration) and **elemental attunements** that reflect those Monsters.

- **Looks:** Any mix of human and monster traits you like.
- **Attunements:** Choose any of the 18 elemental types. Each type grants **flavorful tendencies** (toughness, senses, tolerances) rather than hard “video game powers.”
- **Keep it grounded:** Pick **1–3 manifestations per type** and include a **tradeoff** (e.g., Fire resists heat but risks burnout; Water excels in humidity but struggles in arid heat).
- **Not Pokémon Abilities™:** Use the **elemental attunement guide** as flavor prompts, not as literal move lists.

## Power & Balance Guidelines (Common Sense)
These aren’t extra rules—just advice to keep everyone having fun.

- **No god-moding:** If you give a strong edge, give a practical limit (environmental, stamina, focus, equipment, etc.).
- **Consent-first themes:** Mind control, body horror, or intense psychological effects require opt-in from scene partners.
- **Spotlight sharing:** Gear, summons, or familiars are great—just don’t let a whole army replace your character’s actual play.
- **Environment matters:** Note where your Trainer excels and where they struggle (desert vs. ocean, crowds vs. solitude, etc.).

---

## Gear, Roles, and Skills (Totally Up to You)
- **Gear:** From spears to scanners to sewing kits—carry what fits your concept.
- **Role Ideas:** Ranger, researcher, chef, smith, medic, courier, scholar, breeder, explorer, storyteller… or invent your own.
- **Companions:** Having Monster partners is normal; define your relationship style (mentor, equal partner, caretaker, contractor).

---

## Quick Build Steps
1. **Concept in one line:** “Desert courier who maps stormfronts,” “Gentle giant smith with Steel attunement,” etc.
2. **Species choice:** Human, anthro/variant, hybrid, or Halfwild.
3. **Attunements (optional):** Pick types and **1–3 flavor manifestations** each, plus **tradeoffs**.
4. **Strengths & limits:** What do they do best? What trips them up?
5. **Hook(s):** A goal, a flaw, and a bond (ally, rival, promise, debt, or mystery).

---

## Example Snippets

**Human Linguist (No Attunement)**
- Calm, curious, keeps field notes; great with people, bad with heights.

**Bird-Folk Scout (Flying / Grass)**
- Parkour movement, reads wind and weather; wilts in windowless labs.

**Halfwild (Dragon / Fire)**
- Endures heat and cold, strong presence; slow learner at first, risks burnout.

---

## TL;DR
- **18+, human-level intelligence.**
- Any species form is valid: human, anthro, hybrid, Halfwild.
- Use elemental attunements as **flavor**, not hard powers.
- Give every strength a **reasonable limit**.
- Lead with personality and goals—the cool bits will follow.

Happy creating, Trainer. 🌟
